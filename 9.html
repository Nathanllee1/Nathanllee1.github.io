They have only a few seconds to convince the audience to see their film. Assuming that the film’s ability to elicit emotion drives the decision to see it, filmmakers remove the parts of a trailer that produce neutral emotional responses and splice together the most dramatic parts. Is this practice scientifically valid? It may be useful in some cases.

</span>, as in the term <em>cognitive psychology</em>, is derived from the Latin <em>cogito</em>, which literally means “to think.” Thinking allows us to manipulate information internally to construct models of the world, plan our interactions with that world, and regulate ourselves to meet our goals. As you will see, cognitive psychology covers a broad area of topics. In addition to perception, learning, and memory, which we discussed in previous chapters, cognitive psychology addresses questions of thinking, language, and intelligence.</p> <p id="UBNLEXYNQAP1JL7AY731" id-sequence="49">We think about what we know. In the broadest sense of the word, knowledge is the entire body of information acquired through study, investigation, observation, and experience. To manage this large collection of knowledge, the mind uses symbols, or mental representations, to signify information. Using mental representations is similar to having an icon on your computer desktop that represents Microsoft Word and a profile photograph on Facebook that represents your best friend.</p> <p id="MGPVTRK28T71NXDH2642" id-sequence="50">The most familiar uses of mental representations are found in language, both written and spoken. Depending on the language you choose, you could represent the animal coming toward you on the sidewalk as a <em>hund</em> (German), <em>chien</em> (French), <em>gau</em> (Chinese), <em>perro</em> (Spanish), or <em>dog</em> (English). Representations can be visual too. For example, you could snap a photo or sketch a picture of the dog. Despite the differences in these two visual representations, the dog that each portrays is the same. We can view the representation of the dog (the sound or the appearance of the word used, the patterns of light in your photo or drawing) as a vehicle for carrying information about the content of our knowledge of this dog (it seems to be a friendly, young golden retriever).</p> <p id="HTNUJV7NBAWPKCGQ6951" id-sequence="51">In this chapter, we explore the ability of minds to form mental representations and manipulate them to make sense of the world. What forms can representations take? What are the relationships between the representations and the content they symbolize?</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="52"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="55"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="56" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="57" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="ARXNDBXE9L323VX20372" id-sequence="58"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">10-1a</span> <span class="headingText">Thoughts as Images</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="PRXCJ8TKHQXKBK1AR592_content" id-sequence="59"> <p id="QJQM838CWWELBRS85852" id-sequence="60">Temple Grandin, a college professor with autism spectrum disorder, describes her way of thinking as “thinking in pictures” (<span class="citation" id="BKCVLTAXSFP8PQ53U877" id-sequence="61">Grandin, 2010</span>). Albert Einstein is also widely quoted as relying on mental visualization in the early stages of his thinking and only later putting his ideas into words (<span class="citation" id="EFDGW4FW88NWJ0UDY312" id-sequence="62">Einstein, 1945</span>). To what extent do the rest of us think in mental images? By <em>mental image</em>, we are referring to a representation of any sensory experience that is stored in memory and can be retrieved for use later.

You could tell your alien friend that dogs are furry animals with four legs that bark and wag their tails. Unfortunately, this system has a logical flaw (<span class="citation" id="MZFG63NE5M4ZLKM7T924" id-sequence="137">Wittgenstein, 1953</span>). No matter how careful your definition, even for the simplest concepts, somebody will think of an exception. Although we can agree that all dogs are animals, this feature alone is insufficient for distinguishing dogs from cats and raccoons. Having fur does not describe some chihuahuas, and basenjis don’t bark. A dog that has lost a leg in an accident no longer has four legs. Most dogs we know wag their tails, but there may be an abused dog that keeps its tail perpetually between its legs, as well as dogs that have tails too stubby to wag.</p> <p id="TBCST6XDTKZS4481B538" id-sequence="138">To resolve this dilemma, you can make your definition more flexible. Instead of being rigidly defined by a checklist of features, a concept could describe a group of instances that share overlapping features. This approach is similar to a feature detection model (<span class="citation" id="ZTPT0N4RY4Q8JWDY0554" id-sequence="139">Smith, Shoben, &amp; Rips, 1974</span>). According to this type of model, people determine the truthfulness of statements like “a canary is a bird” by considering overlapping features (wings, beak, flies, and chirps). Using this approach, the alien could compare the features of an animal suspected of being a dog with a checklist of dog features. This approach has problems, too. Some categories are clear, such as triangles, but others do not have precise enough boundaries for the checklist approach to work. People in some cultures would list “taste good” as a feature of dogs, but Americans probably would not. In addition, the feature checklist approach doesn’t seem to match personal experience with thinking. When you think about a dog, do you access a mental checklist of dog features?</p> <div class="pageSection" id="CTANF1CF5WWWPDXSU501" id-sequence="140"> <h3 id="RLFSA0MVS4S22WGV6456" id-sequence="141"><span class="headingText">Prototypes and Exemplars</span></h3> <p id="ELXH56DDLY3QHJEZA534" id-sequence="142">An alternate approach to thinking about concepts is to consider some type of “standard” dog, or a <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1185" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1185"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1185" id="ADMFHX7Z4AN2GY1M1741" id-sequence="143"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">prototype</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="ZCEU0U6BM16NUAE1K509" id-sequence="144">prototype</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A representation of a category formed by averaging all members of the category.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1185">

Whichever standard you choose, you compare new instances to it to get a sense of “fit.” The more similar the new objects are to the standard, the more likely you are to include them in your concept. Both approaches are also able to account for the tendency of people to rate apples as more typical fruits than avocados or robins as more typical birds than penguins (<span class="citation" id="YPARFQB4UMY6NJMFE618" id-sequence="153">Malt &amp; Smith, 1984</span>). Apples are not only closer to the “average” fruit than avocados are, but they are also more likely to be chosen as an exemplar fruit because of the extensive experience most people have with apples, at least in the United States.</p> <p id="TZMYEQWZFEFS6Q4UC930" id-sequence="154">Despite the similarities between the prototype and the exemplar approaches, exemplars have some advantages.

Averages, which characterize prototypes, do not provide much information about the range of features found in a category. For example, imagine that you just met Joe Kovacs, who tells you that he is an athlete. Judging from Kovac’s imposing physical appearance (he weighs 295 pounds), he seems more similar to your prototypical NFL football player than what he is—a star track-and-field athlete. In contrast, while your personal exemplar for a track-and-field athlete might be a sprinter or distance runner instead of a shot-putter like Kovacs, the individual instances that you know can help you comprehend the variability found within the concept.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf163c rs_skip" id="XLCP5FGH2BM78B1J9070" clrenderdata="[&quot;WADT2XKTWXJG0G5PS318&quot;]" id-sequence="156"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf06-t3.jpg" data-width="663" data-height="407"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf06-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="362" data-alt="Two dogs of different breeds and a wolf are shown with a dictionary definition as follows.

The use of prototypes and exemplars rests on similarity. Similar objects will be included in a concept, and dissimilar objects will be excluded. What if your new friend comes across a lifelike dog robot? In many ways, the robot looks and acts like your prototype and exemplar dogs, yet you know it is not a dog. What if you find an unfortunate dog that has been killed on the highway? It hardly retains much similarity to the prototype and exemplar dogs, yet nobody, except perhaps the alien, would question its identity as a dog. Clearly, you need more than prototypes and exemplars to solve your problem.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="TXDFUTFKG6CF7BF7U424" id-sequence="160"> <h3 id="RWXUMGBCEN6U3S5EV861" id-sequence="161"><span class="headingText">Concepts as Theories</span></h3> <p id="VRZAGY3CZ4AXGXJGA205" id-sequence="162">Concept formation can be a type of theory building.

Prototypes and exemplars provide a useful starting place for judging category membership. We test our theory that the new item (avocado) fits the category by comparing it to the prototypes (average fruit) and exemplars (apple) of a concept (fruit). We might make the occasional mistake, such as including bats or excluding ostriches in a concept of “bird,” but most of the time, we will be successful and fast.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf163d rs_skip" id="FPNSP2MK1ZWWXLDNQ735" clrenderdata="[&quot;LSKVQ92G58WDPHQ1Z111&quot;]" id-sequence="164"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf07-t2.jpg" data-width="357" data-height="578" data-alt="Using common features to identify dogs, such as “has hair” or “has four legs,” would exclude these two: a dog with three legs and an American hairless terrier."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="XBUMJEKZZ43203HUQ139" id-sequence="165"><p>Using common features to identify dogs, such as “has hair” or “has four legs,” would exclude these two: a dog with three legs and an American hairless terrier.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:357px;height:578px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_10_unf07-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Using common features to identify dogs, such as “has hair” or “has four legs,” would exclude these two: a dog with three legs and an American hairless terrier." width="357" height="578" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Susan Schmitz/ <a target="_blank" id="CXRJQSTQSN9JK2D2P438" name="CXRJQSTQSN9JK2D2P438" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="166">Shutterstock.com</a>; Eric Isselee/ <a target="_blank" id="LMCT4ZEEK0GVAXDCA746" name="LMCT4ZEEK0GVAXDCA746" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="167">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="URJEB8XRCBV4M1QBG517" id-sequence="168">This approach also has the advantage of being consistent with observations of how children acquire new concepts, which we explore in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-element-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415">Chapter 11</a>.

Ill-defined problems require additional thought about what constitutes an acceptable solution and how the solution should be justified. Reconfiguring an ill-defined problem into a set of well-defined problems can be helpful.

Earlier in this chapter, we talked about forming mental representations of experiences that subsequently can be manipulated by the mind. In the case of problem solving, the mental representations we form relate to how we see the problem. For example, you might represent your weight problem as the result of your holiday splurge or as the result of a broken bathroom scale. These two representations clearly lead to different solutions, and in many cases, your representation will determine how successful you will be at solving the problem.</p> <p id="LLSN38TCHVBJ0TJ5R428" id-sequence="252">Psychologists have identified several helpful suggestions for making the most useful representations of problems and for avoiding some common mistakes that frequently lead to failure. For example, big, long-term problems are easier to solve if they are approached through components or intermediate goals.

Judging and discarding solutions too early in the process also leads to failure. Generating impractical solutions requiring resources we don’t have is not useful.

To illustrate this heuristic, Tversky and Kahneman asked research participants whether Thomas, who is short, slim, and loves poetry, is more likely to be an Ivy League classics professor or a truck driver. Most people assumed that Thomas would be a classics professor because his description is closer to that of a prototypical professor than a prototypical truck driver. However, this conclusion is statistically quite unlikely. There are few Ivy League classics professors, and even if most fit Thomas’s description, the numbers would still be quite low. In contrast, there are thousands of truck drivers in the United States. Even if a small proportion of them shared Thomas’s characteristics, the numbers would be large. Consequently, the odds are that Thomas is a truck driver.</p> <p id="WKBR908XBBPLBB161006" id-sequence="301">Heuristics are most likely to fail when a correct solution requires a sophisticated understanding of probability (<span class="citation" id="LYZDED9YE7GDJPNLM637" id-sequence="302">Fenton &amp; Neil, 2012</span>). For example, a classic American television show originating in the 1960s called <em>Let’s Make a Deal</em> usually ended with a contestant facing three doors (“Behind door number one…”) and knowing that a huge prize, such as a car, was behind one door, and worthless prizes were behind the other two. After the contestant selects a door,<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_373" data-page="373"></a> but before its contents are known, the host reveals that one of the unchosen doors has a worthless prize and asks whether the contestant wishes to switch. Most people erroneously stick with their first door in the mistaken belief that they now have a 50% chance of winning. In fact, their chance of winning with their chosen door remains one-third, but they have a two-thirds chance of winning if they switch. Here’s why. When the contestants first choose, their chance of winning is one-third. When the host reveals another door, he must reveal one of the losing doors no matter what the contestant chose first. If the contestants initially guessed correctly and stay with their original decision, their chance of winning remains one-third. However, if the contestants guessed incorrectly when first asked, switching now guarantees a win, making their chance of winning two-thirds if they switch. The “trick” here is that all the options seem equal (there is a one-third chance of winning, the host reveals one-third of the unknown, and the contestant can switch to the other one-third option), yet they are not truly so (<span class="citation" id="GHBQEE717NEEZPNPR924" id-sequence="303">Fenton &amp; Neil, 2012</span>).</p> <p id="VZEED57T0BUYGCCZ1762" id-sequence="304">Although some of these examples make it sound like heuristics lead to bad decisions, the ability to use heuristics to make quick, effective, and efficient decisions was a significant adaptive advantage for our ancestors (<span class="citation" id="FDCY9YYNBRZ6S82F2520" id-sequence="305">Haselton et al., 2009</span>).

</span> is particularly relevant to the way people make important choices (<span class="citation" id="SYJS39N3W8JB2MKFX026" id-sequence="320">Slovic, Peters, Finucane, &amp; MacGregor, 2005</span>). According to this approach, we use our emotional responses to each choice to guide our decisions. Based on our past experience with similar choices, we develop a “gut” reaction to our options, pushing us toward alternatives we expect to produce desirable outcomes and away from alternatives we expect to produce undesirable outcomes. Our decision making is also affected by the need to avoid the emotion of regret (<span class="citation" id="CVWZ2U6C0BUXHQ0XP793" id-sequence="321">Connolly &amp; Zeelenberg, 2002</span>). By considering ways to justify the reasons for their decisions in advance, people can live more comfortably with the decisions they have made.</p> <p id="DBCY4WFYZ6HY787EM233" id-sequence="322">An alternate approach to decision making, the utility theory, is also popular in economics. According to this theory, we compute the expected outcomes of our choices and select the best likely one. The expected outcome is computed by multiplying measures of the usefulness of the outcome by its expected probability. For example, to choose an elective course for your next term, you might consider a course that provides positive outcomes, such as being interesting and satisfying a graduation requirement. At the same time, you wish to avoid negative outcomes, such as getting a poor grade or spending a lot of money on materials. If you weight each outcome according to its probability and add up the results, you will end up with your own mini cost–benefit analysis.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf164a rs_skip" id="DECQ9V1KQWPGHG12A341" clrenderdata="[&quot;SFBGEZQLF7R9C6TEF823&quot;]" id-sequence="323"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf15-t2.jpg" data-width="472" data-height="369" data-alt="The representativeness heuristic makes us believe that stimuli similar to a prototype are more likely than stimuli that are dissimilar.

It is clear, however, that we rarely make decisions by solving equations. Even when utility is held constant, people show a preference for one solution or the other based on how the solutions are framed. People rate basketball players who are described as making 75% of their free throws higher than those who are described as missing 25% of the time, even though the math is identical in both cases. Medical treatments that are described as effective 80% of the time are viewed more positively than those that fail 20% of the time.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_375" data-page="375"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf164b rs_skip" id="DYPTYTP6NVP7K2FTU825" clrenderdata="[&quot;KFWQRW761QYHQ5RPB828&quot;]" id-sequence="326"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf16-t2.jpg" data-width="442" data-height="354" data-alt="Even though we might carefully weigh the pros and cons of buying one laptop over another, the affect heuristic suggests that we use our emotional or “gut” responses to make decisions too."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="KDUNPDRP816N9T1A2754" id-sequence="327"><p>Even though we might carefully weigh the pros and cons of buying one laptop over another, the affect heuristic suggests that we use our emotional or “gut” responses to make decisions too.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:442px;height:354px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_10_unf16-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Even though we might carefully weigh the pros and cons of buying one laptop over another, the affect heuristic suggests that we use our emotional or “gut” responses to make decisions too." width="442" height="354" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Alex Segre/Alamy Stock Photo </div> </div></div></div> <p id="BQTX5QDHT8YUA6797592" id-sequence="328">Tversky and Kahneman (<span class="citation" id="RRZMY4A279SJ4BRLG608" id-sequence="329">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1987</span>) illustrated the importance of framing in decision making using an Asian disease problem. Even though the outcome in both situations is that 400 people will die, 72% of respondents preferred a more secure solution when the problem was framed using the word <em>saved</em>. In contrast, when the problem was framed using the word <em>die</em>, the secure solution was preferred by only 22% (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="GSRF54HL1NLSU77YL731" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-section-id="FMNXQW9RPFAH69Z7T507" data-element-id="GSRF54HL1NLSU77YL731">Figure 10.7</a>). As we mentioned earlier, the way a problem is represented or framed can have a large effect on whether it will be solved. Framing can affect the choice of a solution through its interaction with a person’s willingness to select risky solutions. When a problem is framed in terms of losses, as in the <em>will die</em> framing of the Asian disease problem, people are more comfortable choosing the risky solution. In contrast, when a problem is framed in terms of gains, as in the <em>saved</em> frame of the Asian disease problem, people generally become more cautious. If we have already “saved” 200 people, we don’t want to risk saving fewer.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf164c rs_skip" id="GSRF54HL1NLSU77YL731" clrenderdata="[&quot;KGTVFL8WV1ERKQGME621&quot;]" id-sequence="330"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_f07-t2.png" data-width="345" data-height="283" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the percentage of respondents choosing a secure or risky solution for a positively or negatively phrased problem.

Solutions that might otherwise succeed can fail when people do not anticipate the time and the resources needed for implementation. It is one thing to decide that you need to exercise more to lose your holiday weight, but without further planning, this solution might not work. How much exercise will you need? What activities should you do? When? Where? Is your solution practical? If you are a couch potato, thinking you will implement your exercise solution by training for next month’s marathon might not be realistic. If time management is not your strongest skill, you might consider tools like an online calendar or a bullet journal.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf164e rs_skip" id="DGYLTW4D6RP4LB5LJ780" clrenderdata="[&quot;HMNCFBYLVRVDVF53U811&quot;]" id-sequence="349"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf18-t2.jpg" data-width="380" data-height="245" data-alt="A diary shows the goals and schedule for a half marathon.

In the example of holiday weight gain, the logical way to assess progress is to get back on the scale at regular intervals. At the same time, solutions usually require time to work, and a failure to make immediate progress should not be the basis for discarding a promising solution.</p> <p id="CUKBZXEZL3KE5NJMC867" id-sequence="360">Evaluation is an ongoing process, but it is especially important once a solution has been fully implemented. You might have predicted that 6 months of exercise should return you to your goal weight. At the 6-month point, we return to the original problem. Does it still exist? If not, the problem has been solved, and you can move on to other issues, although keeping up your exercise program is always a good idea. If the problem still exists, you return to the make-a-plan step and try again. Maybe this time you need to combine exercise with counting calories.</p> <p id="DUCF1M8VFHQLN9PEE674" id-sequence="361">People have a reasonably effective commonsense approach to making decisions, but again, careful psychological research can point out where we are vulnerable to poor decision making.

As we have seen on previous occasions in this textbook, observing the effects of brain damage on a behavior can illuminate the contributions of particular parts of the brain to that behavior. Damage to the frontal lobes of the brain, as in the case of the unfortunate Phineas Gage described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>, reliably produces impulsivity and poor judgment. Patients with this type of damage often begin to gamble obsessively, turn their personal lives upside down, and become unemployable.</p> <p id="NSHDQ06LLWSBU9C3J872" id-sequence="398">Sometimes we need to make fast decisions, perhaps at the expense of accuracy. Different levels of activity in the subthalamic nucleus, part of the basal ganglia (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>), are associated with fast and more cautious decision making (<span class="citation" id="KKZEJWQTSC3MBCX7G841" id-sequence="399">Herz et al., 2017</span>). At other times, you might feel like you are “of two minds” when faced with a decision, and this is not so far from the truth. In reality, three major brain circuits interact during decision making (<span class="citation" id="CRBRXMBB4H3ZFXCF8953" id-sequence="400">Goschke, 2014</span>). One circuit assigns value to situations along the lines of pleasure or pain and involves the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala. A second circuit is an impulse control network that controls unwanted responses and includes the lateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. Finally, an attentional circuit monitors significant stimuli and involves the insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala. This circuit also seems to be involved with more complex social decision making, such as deciding whom to trust (<span class="citation" id="KNNH8K910E84RXEA6050" id-sequence="401">Rilling &amp; Sanfey, 2011</span>).</p> <p id="LRLQ5GEPBF9L22XYQ054" id-sequence="402">The value circuit, which is impulsive, gradually comes under the control of the impulse control circuit as we mature and are exposed to the social rules of our community (<span class="citation" id="RSZFEQA090QKR4B58709" id-sequence="403">Bechara, 2005</span>).

In many ways, drug addicts behave similarly to people who have brain damage in circuits related to decision making. Through their experience with drugs and possibly because of some biochemical consequences of addictive substances, the impulsive system gains control over the impulse control system. The immediate pleasure promised by the drug experience overwhelms the impact of negative future events such as lost jobs, disrupted family life, and even prison. Addicts begin to experience exaggerated responses to the potential reward of drug cues while becoming less responsive to other types of reward (<span class="citation" id="GKRN4ATEKBMGU0YBH334" id-sequence="407">Bechara, 2005</span>). Hyperactivity in this impulsive reward system seems to progressively weaken impulse control.</p> <p id="RPYX6DHKSRV8M7BL2669" id-sequence="408">As you will see in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-element-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415">Chapter 11</a>, the prefrontal cortex is one of the last parts of the brain to mature (development continues into the early 20s), which might account for some of the impulsive, risky decisions made by adolescents (<span class="citation" id="UCZGJTSJBVM50NYUS468" id-sequence="409">Blakemore &amp; Robbins, 2012</span>). At the same time that their impulse control system is relatively weak, adolescents might be hypersensitive to reward. Developmental changes in brain structure and function also account for the effects of peers on adolescent risk taking. Teens and young adults make about the same number of risky decisions while alone, but teens are more likely than young adults to make risky decisions in the presence of their peers.

</span> is a system for communicating thoughts and feelings using arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols. As we discussed previously, language provides us with powerful tools for organizing and manipulating our thinking, problem solving, and decision making. Although thoughts can be represented visually as well as verbally, language extends our thinking abilities to abstract concepts such as truth and beauty that would be difficult to visualize. Above all, language connects us with others. Not only can we communicate with people in our immediate vicinity, but language spans time and distance, allowing us to share the thoughts of people living long ago and in distant places. Because of language, the thoughts we record today might reach into the future to influence the thinking of people not yet born.</p> <p id="XVGDA9NNWEZ27EBQV659" id-sequence="831">Language both reflects and shapes thought. Benjamin Lee Whorf’s hypothesis of linguistic relativity examines the effect of having a rich vocabulary on a person’s ability to think about a topic (<span class="citation" id="MHFNDDKN6ZPM6AAET541" id-sequence="832">Whorf, 1956</span>). According to Whorf, a skier who can name and identify powder, slush, and other variations of snow thinks differently about snow than does a person born and raised in a tropical climate. Whorf’s theory correctly predicted that the use of gender-free words such as <em>server</em> instead of <em>waiter</em> or <em>waitress</em> or <em>flight attendant</em> instead of <em>stewardess</em> would reduce gender stereotyping and discrimination (<span class="citation" id="WAAG3N12L96WQDE2D810" id-sequence="833">Sczesny, Formanowicz, &amp; Moser, 2016</span>). Further efforts to address the binary nature of English personal pronouns (he or she)<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_382" data-page="382"></a> to better reflect a continuum of gender identity have led to the use of completely gender-neutral pronouns (<span class="citation" id="UJHKDQBCSKENYTRYN522" id-sequence="834">Miltersen, 2016</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1657 rs_skip" id="RQYYCX2DEXREK18CZ422" clrenderdata="[&quot;YKBD9CQHKQFE06N2E483&quot;]" id-sequence="835"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf25-t3.png" data-width="766" data-height="414"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf25-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="318" data-alt="According to Benjamin Lee Whorf, a skier who knows what early sintering means, is able to think differently about snow than a person who is unfamiliar with the term.

Elaborate tool use and cooperation would be easier to accomplish using language. Because our version of the human species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, appeared between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, most anthropologists are convinced that human language existed at that time, if not earlier. A critical gene mutation in the <em>FOXP-2</em> gene occurring around 100,000 years ago possibly marked the start of modern language (<span class="citation" id="RKTLPC49FZZTBVS43277" id-sequence="847">Corballis, 2004</span>). Regardless of timing, the enormous advantages of language to human culture and cooperation would ensure its continuity.</p> <p id="NGKCM8L1EEHMKLMYG603" id-sequence="848">Much evidence points to Africa as the source of the first human languages. Some anthropologists suggest that it would be difficult for early humans to migrate successfully to other continents without the cooperation provided by language. Taking a different approach, an analysis of more than 500 contemporary languages has demonstrated that the number of speech sounds in a language decreases systematically with the culture’s distance from Africa along migration routes (<span class="citation" id="KTFQ2P7YV7A49TFNB739" id-sequence="849">Atkinson, 2011</span>).

Most morphemes are words, but word prefixes (as in <em>pre</em>school and <em>sub</em>urban) and word endings (as in dog<em>s</em> and walk<em>ed</em>) also qualify as morphemes because they change the meaning of the root word. English contains approximately 100,000 morphemes, which can be used to produce more than a million words.

</span> is the loss of the ability to speak or understand language. The closely related processes of reading and writing are often, but not always affected by aphasia.</p> <p id="WMJB5092A2Y2MXBAC322" id-sequence="895">In 1861, Paul Broca conducted a case study of a 51-year-old man named Louis Leborgne, who had been institutionalized for more than 20 years (<span class="citation" id="MBSFV8JDXKTVZYS5D707" id-sequence="896">Domanski, 2013</span>). Leborgne came to be called “Tan,” because when questioned, “tan” was one of a few syllables he could produce. Leborgne entered the hospital after several months of being unable to speak. He apparently understood much of what was said to him and retained his ability to answer numerical questions by raising an appropriate number of fingers on his left hand (<span class="citation" id="GVWS9P0JJVLMHH1Y8877" id-sequence="897">Herrnstein &amp; Boring, 1965</span>). After Leborgne died, Broca performed an autopsy on his patient’s brain and found significant damage to the patient’s left frontal lobe, possibly because of Leborgne’s long history of epilepsy. The damaged area is now called Broca’s area in honor of Broca’s discovery (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="VRPE488KP630E78AN470" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-section-id="ALDDJDG26L57TAY76090" data-element-id="VRPE488KP630E78AN470">Figure 10.12</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf165b rs_skip" id="VRPE488KP630E78AN470" clrenderdata="[&quot;YRKX97JXD80KEZ3S0374&quot;]" id-sequence="898"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_f12-t2.png" data-width="460" data-height="405" data-alt="An illustration of a brain showing the brain structures that play a role in language.The labeled parts are Broca’s area motor control of mouth and lips, motor cortex, Wernicke’s area and primary auditory cortex."></div><div class="nb_media image"><div class="mediaTitle" id="DQAR7J785D6A5KGXW957" id-sequence="899"><span class="mediaFigureLabel"><span class="mediaLabelText">Figure </span><span class="mediaFigureNumber">10.12</span></span><span class="mediaAssetTitle">The Major Brain Structures Participating in Language.</span></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:460px;height:405px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_10_f12-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="An illustration of a brain showing the brain structures that play a role in language.The labeled parts are Broca’s area motor control of mouth and lips, motor cortex, Wernicke’s area and primary auditory cortex." width="460" height="405" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">© Argosy Publishing, Inc. </div> </div></div></div> <p id="PZEMKCWT6S63FQ0AN128" id-sequence="900">Today, Leborgne would be diagnosed with Broca’s aphasia. This condition is characterized by difficulty producing speech. The speech that the patient manages to produce is slow and effortful, but it generally makes sense. In some cases, patients retain the ability to curse, as in one of Broca’s other patient’s “Sacre nom de Dieu!” (“In the name of God!”), which he uttered in frustration when unable to make himself understood with gestures. A contemporary patient with Broca’s aphasia described his condition by saying, “Speech … can’t say … talk, you see” (<span class="citation" id="DXKM7FDGKJCVPXVN9414" id-sequence="901">Gardner, 1976</span>, p. 61).</p> <p id="BUKLU13QDM6KG08BL839" id-sequence="902">About 13 years after Broca presented his revolutionary work on Leborgne, Carl Wernicke published his observations on another type of language deficit (<span class="citation" id="FMJDSP6NF2K719TCG817" id-sequence="903">Wernicke, 1874</span>). In honor of his contributions, this syndrome is now called Wernicke’s aphasia, and the affected area of the brain is known as Wernicke’s area. Wernicke’s area is located near the primary auditory cortex, located in the temporal lobe.</p> <p id="QMCC3R6DT2N5CERBV500" id-sequence="904">The symptoms of Wernicke’s aphasia could hardly be more different from those of Broca’s aphasia. Where Broca’s aphasia affects the production of speech, Wernicke’s aphasia affects its comprehension. In Broca’s aphasia, speech is slow and laborious but generally meaningful. In Wernicke’s aphasia, the opposite is true. Speech is rapid and fluent but virtually meaningless. A contemporary patient with Wernicke’s aphasia said,</p> <div class="excerpt" id="ULNBY6W82TTTLFGHF364" id-sequence="905"> <p id="UGBK98RP7VZL9Y9YK106" id-sequence="906">Oh sure, go ahead, any old think you want.

Grammar is generally correct. On further examination, we find that meaningfulness is lacking. These patients are locked into a world without social connection, yet they do not seem aware of their circumstances or in apparent distress.</p> <p id="NFXJ9Q27BNPASRDQD331" id-sequence="909">It is simplistic to assume that the brain has only two main language “centers,” Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Instead, contemporary research has identified complex pathways for processing language that connect Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas to other cortical areas involved in cognition (Dronkers, Pinker, &amp; Damasio, 2000; <span class="citation" id="DGVXVM8FNH9N62J8K179" id-sequence="910"> Friederici, 2011</span>).</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="RBNVY1WZLBAF9UP8J650" id-sequence="911"> <h3 id="FNKTX7J28RY450264043" id-sequence="912"><span class="headingText">Are Nonhuman Animals Capable of Real Language?</span></h3> <p id="QGHDJV2PWDL1RFCZW852" id-sequence="913">Later in this chapter, we discuss several approaches to learning language. The evolutionary approach suggests that language results from some innate capacity shaped by natural selection. Animals and human infants demonstrate similar perceptual grouping, or the linking together of sounds with certain characteristics like the “tick-tock” of a clock (<span class="citation" id="LJNSE6EGCNHPRFWB0137" id-sequence="914">Toro, 2016</span>). This evolutionary view implies that we should find precursors of human language in the behavior of other animals.</p> <p id="FGAMUL1YDC8LBHYDD848" id-sequence="915">Many animals communicate with each other, often in complex ways. All forms of communication, however, do not involve the flexibility and the creativity of language. We can identify three major patterns of animal communication (<span class="citation" id="CPXN1B7U3C2D0BQXJ577" id-sequence="916">Dronkers et al., 2000</span>). One is an inflexible group of calls for signaling danger and identifying territories. A second contains signals that communicate magnitude, as in the case of bee dances. Finally, animals communicate through sequences of behavior, as in the case of birdsong. We don’t know to what extent these animal forms of communication may have served as precursors for human language.</p> <p id="FSVVL8ZVF5Y7R6MYR904" id-sequence="917">The most logical place to look for precursors to human language is the great apes. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have a part of the brain analogous to the human Broca’s area. In both humans and apes, this area shows a difference in size between the right and the left hemispheres that might be correlated with language ability (<span class="citation" id="HGTMADB50S8SH47ZG065" id-sequence="918">Cantalupo &amp; Hopkins, 2001</span>).</p> <p id="FCQWJTTR2NE7MLKYY797" id-sequence="919">Many researchers have attempted to teach human languages to apes. In 1931, Winthrop N. Kellogg and his wife “adopted” a baby chimpanzee, Gua. Because of the limitations of the chimpanzee vocal apparatus, efforts to teach Gua to talk were doomed to failure (<span class="citation" id="XEYY9HKMVRMZZQ4W9939" id-sequence="920">Kellogg &amp; Kellogg, 1933</span>). Allen and Beatrice <span class="citation" id="NKSLALTQJQ49PGPME961" id-sequence="921"> Gardner (1969)</span> taught sign language to a chimp named Washoe. After 4 years of work, Washoe had mastered 132 signs. The Gardners’ efforts were followed by Francine <span class="citation" id="UNFDZM72S4YFGFMS6000" id-sequence="922"> Patterson (1978)</span>, who trained a gorilla named Koko to use signs. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues (1998) have successfully taught a bonobo chimpanzee named Kanzi to associate geometric symbols with words. Even before his training began, Kanzi learned 10 symbols simply by observing his mother’s training sessions, although his mother never quite mastered the task. Kanzi also seems to be able to understand some human speech. When given 660 verbal requests, such as “Put the collar in the water,” Kanzi behaved correctly 72% of the time.</p> <p id="CFGDMDMZT17ZBNU8K020" id-sequence="923">In addition to investigations of language behavior in apes and monkeys, Irene <span class="citation" id="EDXZB40CKFPPRSAJB149" id-sequence="924"> Pepperberg (2014)</span> makes a strong case for her African grey parrots. While we use the phrase “to parrot” to indicate mindless mimicry, Pepperberg argues that her parrots demonstrate complex cognitions related to language.

Word order does not seem to matter to apes, although it has an essential role in human language. Trainers of the apes might be making biased observations. When Washoe signed “waterbird” while observing a swan, the Gardners concluded that she was making a new, creative observation, but Washoe may simply have noticed a “bird” sitting on the “water.” Human infants use cognitive strategies for language learning that are not found in other animals (<span class="citation" id="JFWAHNY1CYKUJABCT778" id-sequence="933">Toro, 2016</span>).

No human culture on Earth exists without language. Language acquisition follows a common course regardless of the native language being learned. Whether a child is exposed to English or Cantonese, similar language structures appear around the same point in development. For example, children all over the world go through a stage in which they overapply language rules, as in the case of a child saying “goed” instead of “went.” Eventually, the child switches to the correct forms, long before formal instruction. In addition, human brain structure is correlated with language.

Many linguists believe that spoken language was built on existing structures that allow primates to produce gestures (<span class="citation" id="FUAPM46VZ7NAMFNQV197" id-sequence="967">Corballis, 2009</span>). Simultaneous vocalizations and gestures (pointing and saying “look”) could have been followed by a greater reliance on vocalizations, which is the same progression we see in children. Vocalization requires less energy than gesturing, as any sign language interpreter can tell you. It also allows communication to occur at night or when hidden, and it frees the hands for tool use and hand-to-hand combat.</p> <p id="AXQP43XUS3BCKM536800" id-sequence="968">Assuming an inborn capacity for learning language further implies that language has a genetic basis. Several genetic conditions selectively affect individuals’ language-learning abilities. A family known as the KE family has members who have severe difficulties with the production of language accompanied by a mutation in the <em>FOXP2</em> gene (Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, &amp; Monaco, 2001). This is the same gene suspected of mutating about 100,000 years ago, making modern human language possible. The <em>FOXP-2</em> gene appears to be critical for learning to produce vocalizations (<span class="citation" id="BWBMYQYL1MJDHQXP2104" id-sequence="969">White, 2013</span>).</p> <div class="container dependent mt_diversevoicesinpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="ZWTVM7VN7KXXAVD9B660" label="diversevoicesinpsychology" id-sequence="970"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Diverse Voices in Psychology</span><h3 id="WPPETVKXC2UY2Q6V0311" id-sequence="971">Is the “Language Gap” Real?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="ZWTVM7VN7KXXAVD9B660_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="972"> <p id="GKEUBKSMWDB7RD55M558" id-sequence="973">Socioeconomic differences impact language acquisition.

Hart and <span class="citation" id="SQSKK2DYD221FFVE4822" id-sequence="975"> Risley (1995)</span> proposed a “language gap,” characterized by the exposure to as many as 30 million more words to children in wealthier families than in poor families by the age of 3 years. This report, widely cited in the popular press, was consistent with a cultural deficit model, in which the poor performance of children from disadvantaged families resulted from low levels of cognitive stimulation. The cultural deficit model has been widely criticized as blaming parents for their children’s poor school performance and being insensitive to cultural differences in the ways parents interact with children.</p> <p id="MHWUZ2D8MWZKN5GL3177" id-sequence="976">Quantity and quality of speech directed at young children are highly correlated, and Hart and Risley noted that quantity of words was just one indicator of possible quality of language exposure. However, the importance of the quantity of exposure remains hotly debated (<span class="citation" id="TKUYYD8B1CDTZM3A1371" id-sequence="977">Baugh, 2017</span>). Many researchers argue that specific aspects related to the quality of the language input to the child, more so than its quantity, predicts later language skills (Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra, &amp; Kuhl, 2014). For example, using “parentese,” or language deliberately simplified for use in communicating with children, was associated with better child language outcomes.

The 19th-century Italian cardinal Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti allegedly spoke 50 languages (Della Rosa et al., 2013). Bilingualism is associated with several benefits.

Prior to brain surgery, surgeons identify which functions are processed by each hemisphere in an individual patient’s brain by anesthetizing one hemisphere at a time. When the left hemisphere of an English-speaking patient proficient in ASL was anesthetized, she made errors in both spoken English and ASL signing. Neither anesthetizing the right hemisphere nor performing subsequent surgery on her right hemisphere produced deficits in either language (<span class="citation" id="PKQREQF8W556U4T7X232" id-sequence="1034">Damasio, Bellugi, Damasio, Poizner, &amp; Gilder, 1986</span>). Despite the spatial nature of ASL, this case suggests that a language is still a language, and the left hemisphere is the likely place for that language to be processed. These clinical observations have been confirmed by imaging studies.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that the intent of IQ tests is to predict school performance as opposed to the complex construct of intelligence described at the beginning of this section.

Robert Sternberg proposed a triarchic theory of intelligence, in which a combination of analytical, creative, and practical abilities allows people to achieve success (<span class="citation" id="PSBL24WQAKDH91CNN300" id-sequence="1130">Sternberg, 1985</span>; <span class="citation" id="XHBDUCRKGL1FLUA8C826" id-sequence="1131"> Sternberg &amp; Salter, 1982</span>).

We can assume that people have separate strengths and abilities, such as those outlined by Gardner and Sternberg. Among these diverse abilities, purely cognitive abilities, such as verbal, mathematical, spatial, and logical skills, show strong positive correlations with one another, supporting an argument for general intelligence, or <em>g</em>. At the same time, abilities involving sensory, motor, and personality factors are less likely to show strong correlations, supporting an argument for multiple intelligences in these domains (<span class="citation" id="JXFANEERDG70DGC7M806" id-sequence="1133">Visser, Ashton, &amp; Vernon, 2006</span>).</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_393" data-page="393"></a> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1134"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1137"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1138" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1139" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="WGRDKDC2GZC7VSM98308" id-sequence="1140"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">10-4c</span> <span class="headingText">Emotional and Social Intelligence</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="DPTWGTGSY5N3CW023438_content" id-sequence="1141"> <p id="GSQTGPJMW0G9W30WX475" id-sequence="1142">Traditional views of intelligence focused on education-related skills, but emotional and social skills are important to successful adaptation too.

In global assessments of math and science proficiency, students from East Asian countries (China, South Korea, and Japan) consistently outscore students from the United States and the European Union, who score around the mean (<span class="citation" id="FCDUDETFW3P6GSYN3310" id-sequence="1149">Guglielmi &amp; Brekke, 2017</span>). Further analysis suggests that the advantage shown by East Asian students is largely predicted by environmental factors, including parents’ educational goals for their children, students’ own educational goals, work ethic, and self-perception. Student self-perception includes a sense of academic efficacy (I can do this) and self-concept (I’m good at this). A not very intuitive finding is that self-concept related to math and science achievement is lowest in the very nations where performance is best! Overestimating one’s abilities and achievement can result in poorer performance. As described in more detail in the Hub Science feature in this chapter, a student’s mindset regarding improvement can also influence performance. The East Asian cultural norms of viewing the self as worthy of improvement increases students’ willingness to accept negative feedback and make corrections (<span class="citation" id="EDKK4URVUY1G2V6BM302" id-sequence="1150">Guglielmi &amp; Brekke, 2017</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf166b rs_skip" id="MUMS3XCCV06V9C3GW914" clrenderdata="[&quot;FJYEEMW3PS52ALK2X359&quot;]" id-sequence="1151"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf40-t2.jpg" data-width="234" data-height="219" data-alt="Some psychologists view social and emotional intelligence as different from “school-based” intelligence and equally if not more important for success.

Some people believe in an entity theory that states that people have a certain fixed, unmodifiable amount of intelligence. Others believe in an incremental theory that states that intelligence is something you can improve through learning. This second approach does not deny that learning is easier for some people than for others but simply suggests that everyone can improve through effort.</p> <p id="YFKW242MRHXGYQSJ8158" id-sequence="1182">Students who believe in entity theory feel best when they complete easy, low-effort tasks and outperform other students. Challenges in the form of difficult tasks or higher performing peers threaten the self-esteem of the entity theorists. Dweck believes that the lavish praise heaped on today’s students promotes belief in the entity theory, resulting in anxiety about looking smart, avoidance of challenges, and an inability to cope with the inevitable educational setbacks. In contrast, incremental theorists like to stretch their skills and put their knowledge to use. They view easy tasks as a waste of time. These students are not as affected by setbacks and worries about looking smart as their entity theorist peers.</p> <p id="PERY7Z53DUM2VU11Z031" id-sequence="1183">Dweck’s two theories about intelligence parallel cultural differences regarding proficiency in math. In the United States, we tend to hold an entity theory of math ability—you have it or you don’t. People feel comfortable admitting that they are “bad at math” and view this as a good reason to stop taking math courses or working to improve. In East Asia, the incremental theory is dominant. Math is viewed as a difficult subject for most people that you must work to master. When Japanese and American students were randomly assigned to succeed or fail on a task by giving them either an easy or difficult task, the two groups responded very differently (<span class="citation" id="UKBTC2E5X7X1HNZZN975" id-sequence="1184">Guglielmi &amp; Brekke, 2017</span>). The Americans who succeeded were more likely to persist on a follow-up task, view the tests as accurate, and rate the skills assessed by the task as important. This pattern was reversed for the Japanese students. The students who failed initially showed the same response as the Americans who had succeeded. As mentioned previously in this chapter, this difference in self-concept probably contributes to the superior achievement in math and science seen in East Asian students relative to their peers with different ethnicities.</p> <p id="KLDP6N55MYG2KRQ6U349" id-sequence="1185">According to Dweck, educators who view self-esteem (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>) as something you “give” to a student through the application of easy tasks, lavish praise, and avoidance of failure are making a big mistake. Instead, self-esteem could be viewed as something students give themselves. Educators can better promote student self-esteem by teaching students to value learning over the appearance of being smart, promoting the love of challenge and effort, and helping students view mistakes as stepping stones to mastery.</p> </div></div><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_396" data-page="396"></a> <p id="UAFKY0HR5N0Q275CV862" id-sequence="1186">Intelligence also seems to be related to the timing of brain development. As children approach puberty, the gray matter of the brain experiences a period of growth that slows down again later in adolescence. Children with average IQ scores showed a peak thickening of cortical gray matter around the age of 8, but children with superior IQ scores experienced a later peak, thickening around age 13 (<span class="citation" id="YYLL6WGGFZ6AB644Q575" id-sequence="1187">Shaw et al., 2006</span>).</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="SQHTEAVWBCMRTE4BK447" id-sequence="1188"> <h3 id="PCGU7E4HZHEB4BQQS674" id-sequence="1189"><span class="headingText">Genetics and Intelligence</span></h3> <p id="TQUGLMSQ5MN7BX1Y9425" id-sequence="1190">As we observed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-chapter-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-element-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455">Chapter 3</a>, simple either–or thinking about nature and nurture is rarely correct when considering human behavior, including intelligence. The influences of heredity (nature) interact intimately with experience and other environmental factors (nurture) to produce a result. For example, infants who are breastfed have higher IQ scores than those who are not. However, the experience of being breastfed increases IQ results only in children with one variation of a gene; it has no effect on IQ results in children with another variation of the same gene (<span class="citation" id="YMZS8KYP311QKJEPT039" id-sequence="1191">Caspi et al., 2007</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf166f rs_skip" id="KSFKUJ29UKH3ZPFFA210" clrenderdata="[&quot;PNTJEC6W99FEHJAYB771&quot;]" id-sequence="1192"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf43-t2.png" data-width="244" data-height="139" data-alt="A comparison of the amount of gray matter in the brains of identical and fraternal twins is shown.

If genes play no role in this variation, such as the likelihood that people have tattoos, heritability is 0. When a condition is completely genetic, such as Huntington’s disease, heritability is 1.0.

When we say that the heritability of intelligence is .75, we are saying that 75% of the variance in intelligence observed in the population can be attributed to genetics, not that 75% of an individual’s intelligence is because of that person’s genes.</p> <p id="BKLWDDJJ4UX339VAU348" id-sequence="1196">As we observed in an earlier section, both overall brain size and proportion of gray matter are correlated with intelligence, and both are approximately 85% heritable, based on comparisons of identical and fraternal twins (<span class="citation" id="UYXSRSPKUUJ5GCGF7807" id-sequence="1197">Gray &amp; Thompson, 2004</span>).

It is likely that a very large number of genes, each having a small impact and interacting with the individual’s environment, contribute to the development of intelligence.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_397" data-page="397"></a> <p id="FLLD49S6SS0QQ3M1K191" id-sequence="1198">The fact that a trait demonstrates high heritability does not imply that change or improvement is impossible. A case in point is the highly heritable condition of phenylketonuria (PKU), in which a person cannot properly metabolize a particular amino acid found in many foods. Left unchecked, the condition leads to intellectual disability, discussed in a later section of this chapter. However, if a person with PKU is given an appropriate diet in which problem foods are avoided, intellectual development proceeds normally. The presence of data showing that IQ results are heritable does not mean we “give up” on anybody’s intellectual development.</p> <p id="PXUAREYBLVV3QJUMB454" id-sequence="1199">Worldwide increases in IQ scores of about 3 points per decade over the last 100 years illustrate the potential for change (<span class="citation" id="FLHVJU7J428J177J8531" id-sequence="1200">Dickens &amp; Flynn, 2006</span>; <span class="citation" id="NGVJM1RZWKHLNVYE7924" id-sequence="1201"> Dickens &amp; Flynn, 2001</span>).

Improvements in nutrition and other health factors probably account for some of the change.

As nations become wealthier and more capable of battling disease, their citizens’ IQ scores increase. Surprisingly, the test score gains are most pronounced in supposed culture-free tests such as the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (<span class="citation" id="MSBCPRJ8WBCJZNNHG533" id-sequence="1203">Fox &amp; Mitchum, 2013</span>). Participants born after 1990 scored far better on these tests than did participants born in 1940. This change might reflect an improvement in the ability to manage dissimilar items that accompanies living in a modern society.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1670 rs_skip" id="ACQAJ6CH4HCEM7CZX530" clrenderdata="[&quot;RVNZ9KT0JPYHX3ERU447&quot;]" id-sequence="1204"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_f18-t2.png" data-width="533" data-height="172" data-alt="A line graph shows a steady increase in U.S. I Q over the years.

</span> or intellectual developmental disorder is diagnosed in individuals who show deficits in intellectual functioning beginning early in childhood, accompanied by deficits in independent living skills. Although individually administered standardized IQ tests are often used as a starting point when evaluating an individual who might have an intellectual disability, the clinician’s impressions can be used to make the decision, too.</p> <p id="QJVBLWP4VBER4CVNQ106" id-sequence="1248">Approximately 1 to 3% of the population will score 70 ± 5 or below on a standardized IQ test (<span class="citation" id="ZLYYCMT3RXJXUCC69477" id-sequence="1249">Szymanski &amp; King, 1999</span>). In addition to an IQ score in this range, individuals with intellectual disability demonstrate problems with adaptive behaviors or life skills. These behaviors might include the ability to balance a checkbook, receive correct change from a cashier, read a bus schedule, buy groceries, maintain personal hygiene, and other skills required for independent living.</p> <p id="HBPGJ8QC5MCWRXG3E088" id-sequence="1250">Intellectual disability is divided into categories of mild, moderate, severe, and profound based on IQ scores and level of adaptive functioning (APA, 2013). Mild intellectual disability is typically accompanied by IQ scores of 55 to 70, or between two and three standard deviations from the mean of 100. With proper intervention, individuals in this group are able to master a sixth-grade curriculum, although it will take them until age 18 to do so. Most individuals in this group can live independently, and many work, marry, and have families.</p> <p id="GHUTZFBQAX1494ZH4774" id-sequence="1251">Mild intellectual disability is typically not the result of genetic or medical problems (<span class="citation" id="JUBGHRJWR41BJXUJQ607" id-sequence="1252">Zigler, 1967</span>; <span class="citation" id="RGUSJWRM10A3PB9CP885" id-sequence="1253"> Zigler &amp; Hodapp, 1986</span>). As a result, mild intellectual disability is frequently called familial retardation, recognizing that it usually results from preventable, environmental causes. Poverty is an obvious risk factor for this condition because poor parents may be unable to obtain the health care, diet, and other environmental benefits needed to produce healthy children (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="WKXD17XEYPTV46NWB411" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-section-id="MYSBYJF4KFQMTP25T752" data-element-id="WKXD17XEYPTV46NWB411">Figure 10.21</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1673 rs_skip" id="WKXD17XEYPTV46NWB411" clrenderdata="[&quot;YBRYP75AR2F27A516295&quot;]" id-sequence="1254"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_f21-t2.png" data-width="479" data-height="168" data-alt="A horizontal bar graph shows that children reported to have intellectual disability by family income, from 2005 to 2008, are a little more than 5 cases per 1000 children above the poverty line, 9 per 1000 children below the poverty line, and 6 per 1000 children of all incomes."></div><div class="nb_media image"><div class="mediaTitle" id="NQCXNKBSGDNVT4U2D618" id-sequence="1255"><span class="mediaFigureLabel"><span class="mediaLabelText">Figure </span><span class="mediaFigureNumber">10.21</span></span><span class="mediaAssetTitle">Poverty Is a Risk Factor for Intellectual Disability.</span></div><div class="mediaDescription" id="CYBPUASKTVVM1SZS8432" id-sequence="1256"><p>Mild forms of intellectual disability, leading to IQ scores between 55 and 70, are also known as familial retardation because these cases are not due to medical or genetic problems.

Unlike mild cases, moderate intellectual disability typically results from genetic or medical conditions rather than familial factors. Genetic conditions such as Down syndrome are likely to produce disability in this range. The academic attainment of most individuals in this category is limited to the second-grade curriculum, and again, most do not achieve this level until about the age of 18 years.

Both severe and profound intellectual disabilities generally result from serious medical conditions and are identified at birth or early in infancy. Individuals with severe intellectual disability can learn a few high-priority words, such as “stop” or “hot.” Individuals with profound intellectual disability can learn some basic self-care skills, such as feeding themselves or washing their hands.

Unfortunately, the structure of public education in the United States, with its emphasis on grade levels based on age, rarely provides optimum learning for gifted children. A report by the U.S. Department of Education noted that children with IQ scores of 140 or above typically know at least half of a grade’s curriculum before the school year even begins, and those with IQ scores of 170 or above know virtually all of it (U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement, 1993). Their time in school is subsequently wasted, and the material is so easy that it encourages poor learning habits ill-suited to later educational challenges. Educators are returning to ability groupings and acceleration to resolve these problems. These practices benefit not only the more gifted students, but they also provide benefits for average and below-average students, although equitable assignment to groups remains a concern (Steenbergen-Hu, Makel, &amp; Olszewski-Kubilius, 2016).</p> <div class="container dependent mt_interpersonalrelationships narrative  rs_skip" id="TWARX8QHBF5JDD94N875" label="interpersonalrelationships" id-sequence="1289"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Interpersonal Relationships</span><h3 id="FRUETE025JTZDEV8M711" id-sequence="1290">The Cognitive Perspective</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="TWARX8QHBF5JDD94N875_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1291"> <div class="pageSection" id="THPZN3BFTBJL2W20X370" id-sequence="1292"> <h3 id="VBATVQKLMPKG5ZQHH989" id-sequence="1293"><span class="headingText">How Does Being a Maximizer or a Satisficer Affect Relationships?</span></h3> <p id="DEMUPVPF7NB56JSS5325" id-sequence="1294">Classic research suggests that some people are “maximizers,” who strive to reach the best outcome. “Satisficers” are more willing to choose outcomes that are merely acceptable (<span class="citation" id="PPNDD006BLEC9YCLQ383" id-sequence="1295">Simon, 1957</span>). Maximizers are perfectionists who evaluate all choices before settling on one, so they do not make quick decisions. Because maximizers feel more regret when a decision doesn’t work out well, they tend to avoid making decisions. Although they may experience better outcomes than satisficers on many occasions, maximizers might still feel worse. Satisficers are more likely to see their glass of life as half full, whereas maximizers are more likely to see their glass as half empty.</p> <p id="AVDXTTTM0Y1SC5RLQ303" id-sequence="1296">What does this distinction mean for interpersonal relationships? Finding a romantic partner and making a long-term commitment to that person involve some important decisions. Romance is consistently ranked among the top regrets in life for most people (<span class="citation" id="GXNBP1UDK0N6JND44807" id-sequence="1297">Roese &amp; Summerville, 2005</span>). These facts suggest that maximizers might experience obstacles within the realm of relationships. Either they will let opportunities pass by because they are still looking for that perfect person, or they will avoid making a commitment for fear of regretting it later. Their perfectionist standards might make it impossible for them to appreciate a partner who is a good match, perhaps because that person does not look like a supermodel or squeezes the toothpaste tube the wrong way.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1677 rs_skip" id="ZMBBRH8839R38FYFF009" clrenderdata="[&quot;PSPGNXKZT4RB400J3593&quot;]" id-sequence="1298"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf45-t2.jpg" data-width="379" data-height="245" data-alt="Faced with a large array of choices, satisficers will pick one that works, but maximizers will evaluate all the options to find the perfect choice.

Not at all. Recognizing that our automatic ways of behaving will not always lead us to our goals can help us identify areas where we need to take conscious, systematic control. Many maximizers blame their partners for a failed romance (the partner just didn’t measure up) instead of taking a hard look at their own contributions to the relationship.

Perhaps you have a personal acquaintance who is known to be a cyberbully. This might be your exemplar. You might also consider a prototypical or average cyberbully based on your personal experience and what you have heard from others or read. Take a moment and write down a list of what you think might be the key features that define the category of cyberbully.</p> <p id="CHUUJZBSWPACK2N9M825" id-sequence="1307">Now let’s see what psychological science has to say, and you’ll be able to see where the features of your category agree or disagree with the scientific literature. Did you make a conclusion about gender? Prior research has shown that girls are less likely to participate in traditional bullying, but their role in cyberbullying remains unclear. Researchers have reported that slightly more males than females engage in cyberbullying (<span class="citation" id="JZUTT326Q4AV4XZTG518" id-sequence="1308">Aricak et al., 2008</span>; <span class="citation" id="VEGQ5ZXBYVMCBE3Y5725" id-sequence="1309"> Li, 2006</span>; <span class="citation" id="HEZDGT5USWD0E63W8757" id-sequence="1310"> Slonje &amp; Smith, 2008</span>), more females than males engage in cyberbullying (<span class="citation" id="BAEG3G8C9TG42CCGT883" id-sequence="1311">Kowalski &amp; Limber, 2013</span>), or that there are no significant gender differences in perpetrators of cyberbullying (<span class="citation" id="EUSQQW4MHZXEP92K3356" id-sequence="1312">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</span>). Given these mixed results, we might assume that gender is not a very helpful feature in establishing a cyberbully profile.</p> <p id="SMHA4B8W5B2XSNBBH221" id-sequence="1313">Age might be a useful dimension for our concept of cyberbully. Is there a particular age range where this behavior is more common? If you guessed that cyberbullying peaks around age 14, then you are correct (Cook, Williams, Guerra, &amp; Tuthill, 2007). Knowing this could be very helpful. You would not want to plan an educational program to be administered to students who are past this peak age group, thereby missing the main targets of your interventions.</p> <p id="TSBD8QBEPXEBLVMTK520" id-sequence="1314">Some other characteristics of cyberbullies are intuitive. Cyberbullies are more expert in their use of the internet than their noncyberbullying peers, and they experience less parental supervision (Vandebosch &amp; Van Cleemput, 2009). As we have seen in other situations, however, intuitive conclusions are not always consistent with scientific facts. You might have a prototype or exemplar cyberbully in mind who is socially awkward and more likely to be a victim of traditional bullying than to be a perpetrator. Facts show that cyberbullies are actually more socially competent than their peers, not less, and they are about equally likely to engage in traditional bullying as they are in cyberbullying (Vandebosch &amp; Van Cleemput, 2009).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1678 rs_skip" id="LLQXEJ7E80UDDUWG2556" clrenderdata="[&quot;MWXQR0L930U0QT0YB467&quot;]" id-sequence="1315"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_10_unf46-t2.jpg" data-width="382" data-height="276" data-alt="Two children - one bullying the other."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="WUJGVYZBVZG4ZGKUB198" id-sequence="1316"><p>Widely held stereotypes about who is more likely to cyberbully are not always supported by scientific research.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:382px;height:276px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_10_unf46-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Two children - one bullying the other." width="382" height="276" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Rubberball/Mike Kemp/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <p id="RCXJTKUWZEF4WJMGM080" id-sequence="1317">How did you do?

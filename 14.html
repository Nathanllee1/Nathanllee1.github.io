CBT was developed based on the principles of classical and operant conditioning that were discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>. In the case of OCD, a woman with hand-washing compulsions could be trained to anticipate when she might feel like washing her hands inappropriately. Then, she would engage in some competing activity—perhaps going out to her garden to pull some weeds or pick some flowers. Finally, she would reward herself for resisting the temptation to wash her hands too much.</p> <p id="SUDZFLPMKY0H6R8Z5165" id-sequence="31">Is it possible to show differences in brain activity resulting from CBT? The answer is “yes” (<span class="citation" id="AVWJUFPPWJ24C2D4V417" id-sequence="32">Baxter et al., 1992</span>). Zooming in, we can see what happens to a person’s brain by using a positron emission tomography (PET) scan following therapy for OCD. A PET scan provides a measure of brain activity. The red and yellow areas are considerably more active than the green, blue, and dark<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_595" data-page="595"></a> areas. When people with OCD who have been treated with CBT are compared to people treated with medication, their PET scans show the same decrease in activity in the basal ganglia. Because medication can produce unwanted side effects and is not effective for all people, it is fortunate that alternate therapies are available.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1790 rs_skip" id="QXRCYZ4RFPMW4TEUC226" clrenderdata="[&quot;JRVN9E02J4ZYZPKSE618&quot;]" id-sequence="33"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf01-t2.jpg" data-width="293" data-height="253" data-alt="A photo shows hands washing with soap under running water."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:293px;height:253px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf01-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows hands washing with soap under running water." width="293" height="253" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Yuri Arcurs/ <a target="_blank" id="RAWCS7RYUEUL7ESB8238" name="RAWCS7RYUEUL7ESB8238" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="34">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="UDDQSEG7Q1LTE703L911" id-sequence="35">This chapter will explore a number of approaches that have been used to improve the situations of people with psychological disorders. Some represent a variety of psychological treatments, like the behavioral approach to OCD discussed here, while others take the form of medication and other biological treatments. The effects of these treatments might have more in common than you think, as in the case of the changes in brain activity that result from the psychological and biological treatments of OCD. Just as we have argued for the advantages of integrating psychological perspectives to understand behavior and mental processes, the field of clinical psychology is recognizing the benefits of applying multiple perspectives to the treatment of psychological disorders.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1791 rs_skip" id="UYCUUB1GV3TC22HDZ620" clrenderdata="[&quot;KSMKMMJ8TCNB7SM73418&quot;]" id-sequence="36"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="292" data-height="253" data-alt="Healing the Troubled Mind"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:292px;height:253px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Healing the Troubled Mind" width="292" height="253" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">TAGSTOCK1/ <a target="_blank" id="RWMD6BUGA8P3APSAS931" name="RWMD6BUGA8P3APSAS931" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="37">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> </div><div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="38"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="41"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="42" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="43" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="ZBZVAE9BDSX2CQ9TS736" id-sequence="44"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">15-1</span> <span class="headingText">How Do Psychologists Provide Therapy?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="LBJT1A1EBE0VLNREL605_content" id-sequence="45"> <p id="FPZQ7UYXVK6YCH815167" id-sequence="46"><a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a> explored a diverse range of problems that can contribute to personal and interpersonal distress. Once considered virtually untreatable, many of these disorders respond positively to the treatments available today. Unfortunately, many people with disorders still do not seek help, possibly because of stigma related to having a psychological problem or a lack of awareness that effective help is available (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="SFLLL9D9HNQ8Z3CWE223" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-section-id="LBJT1A1EBE0VLNREL605" data-element-id="SFLLL9D9HNQ8Z3CWE223">Figure 15.1</a>).

</span>, which generally involve a conversation between the professional providing the therapy and the person seeking help, are often combined with biological treatments, such as the medications described in more detail in later sections of this chapter. For example, a person who is terrified of being part of a crowd might benefit from a combination of psychotherapy and medication for anxiety. As will be shown in this chapter, different combinations of methods can be tailored to different types of problems and to the individuals being treated.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="YRFJK66D4HSM7F27J791" id-sequence="70"> <h3 id="NPCFL10FWZJYUYU66834" id-sequence="71"><span class="headingText">Biological Approaches</span></h3> <p id="ZTVU1EP4UNR4H927G643" id-sequence="72">Biological approaches to treatment have their roots in our understanding of the biological factors that contribute to psychological disorders. Along with the overall burst of scientific and medical knowledge beginning in the 18th century, scientists began to learn more about psychological disorders and their causes. This knowledge in turn set the stage for the discovery of more effective biological treatments.</p> <p id="PPCPSXLV9MBJSYSVU647" id-sequence="73">Improved medical knowledge made psychological disorders less mysterious. When untreated, syphilis (a common type of sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacterial infection) can produce a characteristic set of abnormal behaviors, including hallucinations, delusions, and changes in mood and personality. As noted in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a>, these behaviors are characteristic of a number of psychological disorders, including schizophrenia. The discovery that behaviors like hallucinations could have a biological cause led to the recognition that abnormal behavior can result from infection or other medical conditions. In these cases, the abnormal behaviors should disappear when the underlying medical condition is treated.</p> <p id="RNDKMAJUTTN6PM1HQ633" id-sequence="74">The use of one biological approach to treatment, medication, revolutionized the care of people with some psychological disorders. In 1949, an Australian psychiatrist named John Cade discovered that lithium salts could produce remarkable improvements in the behavior of patients with bipolar disorder. Cade’s discovery was followed quickly by breakthroughs in the use of medication to treat schizophrenia. Bolstered by these successes with some of the most troubling psychological conditions, the pharmaceutical industry quickly introduced<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_597" data-page="597"></a> medications for depression and anxiety. These successes not only led to better outcomes for many patients, but also strengthened the credibility of using biological approaches to treat abnormal behaviors.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1794 rs_skip" id="CKSJ380XESQH76GVP797" clrenderdata="[&quot;HSCTMYUTBM2AYZB92456&quot;]" id-sequence="75"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf04-t2.jpg" data-width="270" data-height="380" data-alt="A photo shows a pill bottle and pills next to it."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="BFTZAZZP48Y3SDC8P976" id-sequence="76"><p>Australian psychiatrist John Cade searched for alternatives to the ECT, lobotomies, and psychoanalysis that were commonly used to treat psychological disorders in the 1940s. After observing that lithium salts had a sedating effect on guinea pigs, he tried lithium on himself to test for side effects. He then tried lithium on his patients and noticed that those with bipolar disorder appeared to respond favorably. Lithium is an element, so it could not be patented, providing little financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry. However, lithium was approved for use in the United States in 1970. Lithium salts continue to be used extensively to treat bipolar disorder, although we now understand that this treatment has serious side effects.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:270px;height:380px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf04-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows a pill bottle and pills next to it." width="270" height="380" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Phil Degginger/Science Source </div> </div></div></div> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="TKZHM06B3KHRKQF8R184" id-sequence="77"> <h3 id="PVNHFUTP9C98WRPYS219" id-sequence="78"><span class="headingText">Psychological Approaches</span></h3> <p id="CNPJ4RDE54MYPFP1V279" id-sequence="79">Running parallel to the successes of scientists engaged in biological approaches to disorders were significant contributions from those who focused on the psychological and emotional underpinnings of disorders.</p> <p id="KGWEFTAWQJD0TMHFX306" id-sequence="80">During the 19th century, psychologists and psychiatrists were interested in hysteria, a condition that would be diagnosed today as somatic symptom disorder (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a>). Hysteria did not seem to have any biological basis and did not respond to the medical treatments of the day. Among the first efforts to treat hysteria through nonmedical means was the use of hypnosis by Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), whose name gives us an alternative term for being hypnotized—<em>mesmerized</em>. Mesmer attempted to treat hysteria by inducing a hypnotic state, which was described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-chapter-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-element-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957">Chapter 6</a>. In many cases, people with hysteria no longer experienced their symptoms under hypnosis and, following Mesmer’s suggestions made during hypnosis, continued to be symptom free even after they left the hypnotic state.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1795 rs_skip" id="YHVGS4SZPM8V77R82689" clrenderdata="[&quot;YJLE0S82FXT4E03Z8094&quot;]" id-sequence="81"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf03-t2.png" data-width="246" data-height="340" data-alt="A sketch shows Franz Anton Mesmer standing against a woman seated on a chair.

When positive outcomes were reported by the noted French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893), hypnosis and suggestion took on a new legitimacy in the scientific community. Among the admirers of Charcot and his work were Josef Breuer (1842–1925) and his more famous colleague, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). As will be discussed later in this chapter, Freud eventually abandoned his interest in hypnosis in favor of other approaches, which eventually gave rise to psychoanalysis. Instead of hypnotizing people, Freud encouraged them to speak freely about whatever came to mind.</p> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="LTXB667DYZJK1XE6B718" id-sequence="84"><div class="sidebarContent" id="LTXB667DYZJK1XE6B718_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="85"> <p id="SSVDKNRTQYZV55UUN029" id-sequence="86">Franz Anton Mesmer’s methods for using hypnosis to treat hysteria were quite theatrical and were denounced as fraudulent by none other than Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as the U.S. ambassador to France at the time.</p> </div></div> <p id="KFHZYHC1AWW9P4KUQ391" id-sequence="87">During the 20th century, psychological approaches to treatment reflected the rise of the behavioral and humanistic perspectives, described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-element-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785">Chapters 1</a>, <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">8</a>, and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">12</a>.

Because of their training and licensure as physicians, psychiatrists are allowed to perform the medical procedures reviewed later in this chapter, particularly the prescribing of medication. It is difficult to generalize across the entire profession, but psychiatrists are more likely to look for the causes of disorder in biological factors than in learned or environmental factors and to assume that a biological treatment such as medication will be most effective. In addition, the medical model does not see treatment as taking place within a relationship of equals. Instead, expertise is simply transmitted from the doctor to the patient, and little input is expected from the patient. We will see alternatives to this model in the procedures conducted by other types of therapists.</p> <p id="KSFWBPNTKN6NSGH2P028" id-sequence="127">The word <em>psychologist</em> is used to describe professionals who have completed advanced degrees in psychology, including those who become psychotherapists. Most psychologists, including the professors teaching your introductory course, earn the traditional academic doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree in psychology, but not all choose career paths as licensed psychotherapists. Clinical psychology is the path taken by psychology graduate students who wish to study, teach, or practice psychotherapy. In addition to completing the academic requirements for a PhD degree, clinical psychology students must spend an additional year providing treatment in a supervised internship.</p> <p id="HFDTBNMDMFAABGG2P041" id-sequence="128">Beginning in the 1970s, an alternative route to becoming a clinical psychologist arose from suggestions that the practice of psychology could be modeled after dental and medical schools (<span class="citation" id="FTRH08ZKNZJM3U7NH849" id-sequence="129">Norcross &amp; Castle, 2002</span>). The doctor of psychology (PsyD) degree was developed to train students to provide services without undergoing the extensive training in research methods that characterizes the PhD degree.</p> <p id="YNWVWCCEWLXGJ38SW151" id-sequence="130">Both PhD and PsyD programs can earn accreditation by the American Psychological Association (APA). PsyD programs are becoming increasingly popular with students (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PYMS72PLRBUW6HZRL498" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-section-id="ALQV1XHFVD78DH27F442" data-element-id="PYMS72PLRBUW6HZRL498">Figure 15.4</a>). However, the lack of emphasis on research that is characteristic of the PsyD degree has led to concerns about the ability of these graduates to think scientifically about their choice of methods (<span class="citation" id="RUKY896VPVXH5W2RA053" id-sequence="131">Baker et al., 2008</span>). For example, without a solid background in science, objective evaluation of and adherence to the EBP model could be quite difficult.

The requirements for already-licensed clinical psychologists to gain prescription privileges are quite rigorous.

However, these types of services are also provided by counselors, who typically do not provide services for psychological disorders such as schizophrenia. In other words, a couple experiencing marital conflict might seek either a counselor or a clinical psychologist, whereas a person experiencing hallucinations and delusions is more likely to be treated by a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist. Counselors hold master’s or doctoral degrees in psychology and related fields, such as education and social work.</p> <p id="YGYQ8E0QSJTSMQSBW083" id-sequence="140">Students pursuing undergraduate psychology degrees frequently ask what they can do in the mental health field without a graduate degree.

But that chapter also recounted the example of Zoe D. Katze, who is a hypnotherapist certified by the National Guild of Hypnotists, the American Board of Hypnotherapy, and the International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association. She is a professional member of the American Association of Professional Hypnotherapists. As you may recall, Zoe also happens to be a cat, owned by a psychotherapist named Steve Eichel, who obtained the credentials for her to make a point about the weaknesses of accreditation in this area (<span class="citation" id="TWQRE4LKB9GM31BL6007" id-sequence="146">Eichel, 2002</span>).</p> <p id="SYKT8M352MTS4Y84W412" id-sequence="147">Another unregulated area in the provision of psychological services is the field of life coaching, which requires no licensing. According to the International Coach Federation (ICF, n.d.) <em>coaching</em> is defined as “partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential.” Substitute <em>psychotherapy</em> for <em>coaching</em> in this definition, and few would disagree with the resulting statement. Coaches seem to perform the same duties as psychotherapists and counselors. Some psychotherapists have found that referring to themselves as <em>coaches</em> expands their practices, possibly because of the reduced stigma of seeing a coach rather than a therapist in the minds of some clients. Life coaching also provides the advantage of being more appealing to men, who generally seek more traditional psychotherapy in much smaller numbers than do women (McKelley &amp; Rochlen, 2007).</p> <p id="GDVKDW2TFBTW95PK1445" id-sequence="148">Few studies have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of coaching, but those that have done so note that clients are satisfied with the services (<span class="citation" id="NRHD9WRAZTCCDMGQJ801" id-sequence="149">Grant, 2003</span>) and experience improved coping and self-regulation (Theeboom, Beersma, &amp; van Vianen, 2014). Many studies appear in journals that are essentially trade publications, such as the <em>International Journal of Evidence-Based Coaching &amp; Mentoring</em>, the <em>International Coaching Psychology Review</em>, and <em>Coaching: An International Journal</em>.</p> <p id="AJLWEMYSTP041ZUNB349" id-sequence="150">In spite of the lack of regulation and licensure, life coaching is becoming a big part of the delivery of psychotherapeutic services, even within health care settings (<span class="citation" id="EKKGR3QG4ZR551RZD778" id-sequence="151">Ammentorp et al., 2013</span>). Corporations spend in the vicinity of $1.5 billion per year on workplace coaching services provided by the approximately 30,000 professional coaches who are active globally (Grant, Passmore, Cavanagh, &amp; Parker, 2010).</p> <p id="DCVRKKS2GH2M24H6Q077" id-sequence="152">Although licensure provides significant protection for the public, any consumer of psychological services must thoroughly investigate prospective psychotherapists. Zoe D. Katze may be an extreme example, but we suspect that she is not unique. Credentials are not always what they seem. For example, the author of the 1992 best seller <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</em> lists himself as “Dr. John Gray” (John Gray’s Professional Bio, 2017), but provides no information on his educational background or licensure. Gray spent nine years as a monk under the leadership of the Beatles’ guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the Science of Creative Intelligence from the unaccredited Maharishi European Research Institute in Switzerland, and a PhD degree from the now-defunct<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_602" data-page="602"></a> and unaccredited Columbia Pacific University in California, which was described by the state government as a “diploma mill.” Because of his experience as a monk, the state of California recognizes him as a “spiritual counselor,” which technically allows him to provide advice. More recently, Gray has been joined by his daughter Lauren, who also provides no educational or licensing material about herself on the website.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf179b rs_skip" id="GUSJ0XJ3MJNCTRSP5485" clrenderdata="[&quot;LKEVM3G99V8GDFHF6117&quot;]" id-sequence="153"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf07-t2.jpg" data-width="248" data-height="340" data-alt="Donald Asher writes and speaks about career hunting, college applications, and résumé building, topics often presented by life coaches.

In CBT, described in detail in a later section, sessions might occur once per week for about six weeks. Given rates of $150 or more per hour for individual therapy, insurance providers are pressuring psychotherapists to find faster, cheaper, and more efficient ways to provide treatment.

Family therapy is frequently used when a child or teen is experiencing problems, because these problems typically affect and are affected by the behavior of other family members. Family therapists face a number of significant challenges. In some cases, the member who seems to need treatment the most refuses to participate. In others, maintaining the confidentiality of all participants can be difficult. A teen might disclose information that will help the parents do their job better, but sharing this information with the parents could interrupt the trust that the therapist has built up with the teen.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf179f rs_skip" id="MLCVKPALE7XF89Y4D564" clrenderdata="[&quot;EYFPMUUJHBSFHL2S5486&quot;]" id-sequence="194"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf11-t2.jpg" data-width="400" data-height="247" data-alt="Family therapy combines individual sessions with sessions that include some combination of family members, like these parents and their young daughter."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="ADUFQJJL8YM3Q5WVR760" id-sequence="195"><p>Family therapy combines individual sessions with sessions that include some combination of family members, like these parents and their young daughter.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:400px;height:247px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf11-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Family therapy combines individual sessions with sessions that include some combination of family members, like these parents and their young daughter." width="400" height="247" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Frank Pedrick/The Image Works </div> </div></div></div> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="WKLPG9HPPDPQNMZ9V376" id-sequence="196"> <h3 id="NQAC6FE3CB9GL84JJ165" id-sequence="197"><span class="headingText">Innovative Delivery Systems</span></h3> <p id="ACNFSPCXDRDBXSW3K248" id-sequence="198">An emerging delivery system for psychotherapy is online therapy. When “online therapy” is used as a Google search term, more than 11,600,000 results are returned. The benefits of privacy, engaging in therapy from home, and the ability to choose a suitable therapist regardless of location provide significant advantages for some clients. In its early days, online therapy was conducted through e-mail or chat services.<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_604" data-page="604"></a> Because the written word conveys less information than a therapist obtains face to face, this method could be less desirable. However, many online therapists have taken advantage of Skype and other voice and video technologies. Online delivery of CBT has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face CBT for a number of psychological conditions (<span class="citation" id="TWNYCDHCLQ7VW1KDJ046" id-sequence="199">Herbst et al., 2014</span>; <span class="citation" id="BWRW141H7YP6G8CT5166" id-sequence="200"> Sijbrandij, Kunovski, &amp; Cuijpers, 2016</span>).</p> <p id="TSYNJDJTBUSK5BDCG390" id-sequence="201">Other technologies have influenced the delivery of psychotherapy. Therapists can buy products such as Wiley’s TheraScribe, a computer program that includes more than 2,500 prewritten interventions, goals, objectives, and suggested diagnoses. The program generates reports catering to Medicare and other managed care organizations. The time savings provided by these technologies can be useful in controlling costs, but receiving a prewritten evaluation might seem somewhat impersonal to individuals seeking therapy. If you receive a treatment plan from your campus health center that is nearly identical to a friend’s, you might not feel that the counselor cared about you as an individual.</p> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="202"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="205"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="206" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="207" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="KJDE8RGEFZLZVTTHS088" id-sequence="208"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">15-1d</span> <span class="headingText">Contemporary Challenges in Treatment</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="NKYVQ8Y0JFDD2DM3U217_content" id-sequence="209"> <p id="JSMVYJZ22K6CKTGS9678" id-sequence="210">Providing treatment for psychological disorders has changed dramatically since the days of Freud. Originally, therapy was provided by individual professionals in small private practices. However, this model became increasingly rare in the latter part of the 20th century, as psychological treatments became more likely to be managed by large organizations, including insurance companies. Many of the concerns about these new models of managed psychological treatment echo complaints from the medical community regarding contemporary medical treatment. Decisions formerly made by the therapist about the types of disorders that warranted treatment and the length, frequency, and type of treatment to be offered are now more likely to be made by insurance company personnel who lack medical or psychological training and focus more on costs (<span class="citation" id="XVGF7Q2GFKL9EEU11250" id-sequence="211">Baker et al., 2008</span>).</p> <p id="AUABE3HTY3L71HCYC912" id-sequence="212">In addition to the need to adapt to the managed care of psychological disorders, psychotherapy faces many of the same challenges as medicine in providing scientifically valid treatments. Just as we would expect a physician to provide a scientifically supported treatment for cancer, we should expect a psychotherapist to provide equally well-documented treatments for depression. In the earlier section on EBP, we joined most research clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in endorsing the use of science in selecting, implementing, and evaluating psychological treatments.

The American Psychological Association has the primary responsibility for accrediting programs that train clinical psychologists with either PhD or PsyD degrees in the United States. This system has been challenged by a new accreditation body, the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS, 2017), which specifically aims to increase the scientific basis of clinical treatment and research literacy among clinical psychologists. Since 2007, the PCSAS has accredited 32 programs, with several more under review (PCSAS, 2017). Time will tell whether PCSAS will be able to nudge the clinical psychology community into greater reliance on research-based methods.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_diversevoicesinpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="YVUU8545CQ6X3TQ3M453" label="diversevoicesinpsychology" id-sequence="216"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Diverse Voices in Psychology</span><h3 id="PZUDX20B8H315ZYVP424" id-sequence="217">Culturally Competent Counseling and Psychotherapy</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="YVUU8545CQ6X3TQ3M453_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="218"> <p id="WGGEH6EVTXPRRA4NM042" id-sequence="219">Among the barriers to obtaining counseling and psychotherapy services faced by racial and ethnic minority individuals in the United States are cultural distrust, racial and ethnic norms related to self-reliance and privacy, and concerns about culturally sensitive providers (<span class="citation" id="HWFJL1ZNU72KLQXBN709" id-sequence="220">Hayes, McAleavey, Castonguay, &amp; Locke, 2016</span>).</p> <p id="VCCK8AFE3D7PKCDSG179" id-sequence="221">Psychologists have begun to identify interventions that might address these barriers by offering greater cultural competency.

In particular, Freud emphasized the importance of conflict among the self (ego), the aggressive energy of the id, and the restrictions supplied by society (superego). Freud’s view of the ability of the unconscious mind to affect behavior is also central to his therapeutic approach. Because of Freud’s training as a physician, psychoanalysts take a directive role, which means that they are in charge of the session. Like your physician, the psychoanalyst does not expect contributions from you other than information about your symptoms.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_607" data-page="607"></a> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="TNKY5YVP3534G5RPN340" id-sequence="301"><div class="sidebarContent" id="TNKY5YVP3534G5RPN340_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="302"> <p id="EWQV1WWPRRB5GGUHW574" id-sequence="303">Freud called his slips “faulty actions.” For example, a man texting his partner “I wish you were her” instead of “I wish you were here” would have a great deal of explaining to do.

</span>. Insight therapies assume that people will improve once they understand their problems. For Freud, many psychological disorders arose from problems that resided in the unconscious mind, out of conscious awareness. Although the person might not be consciously aware of these continuing conflicts, the conflicts exert their influence on behavior and through dreams. For example, a patient might arrive at the therapist’s office complaining about her inability to enjoy a satisfactory sex life with a beloved spouse. Although many factors could contribute to such problems, the psychoanalyst is likely to suspect the influence of some traumatic experience that is relatively unavailable to the patient’s conscious thoughts. Perhaps the patient is the victim of childhood sexual abuse, or she might be experiencing a conflict between the ultrastrict morality that she learned from her parents and her current desire to have a fulfilling relationship with her partner. For the psychoanalyst, the “cure” lies in uncovering the unconscious contributions to the patient’s problems. Once she understands the source of her problems (the insight), her situation should improve.</p> <p id="RNYWY5BWPUS7PBKZZ941" id-sequence="307">How does one go about uncovering unconscious material?

</span>. Free association occurs when a person says whatever comes to mind. As we mature, most of us become aware that we do not literally “speak our mind” out of consideration for our fellow humans. Although small children might tell a person, “You’re fat,” such comments, although they may be true, are not the type that most adults consider polite. We learn to think before we speak. To engage in free association, this self-censor must be turned off, allowing the patient to verbalize those thoughts that are typically withheld. Without the self-censor, the famous “Freudian slips” might occur and are assumed to reflect unconscious wishes.</p> <p id="PGEL3J3QPMCKHB2CN071" id-sequence="310">Not all psychoanalysts engage in dream analysis, but it is likely that therapists interested in dream analysis are psychoanalysts. For Freud, dreaming represented a reflection of unconscious wishes and, therefore, a potential source of useful insight into the unconscious mind. If patients are undergoing dream analysis, they are encouraged to awaken following a dream to jot some notes that can later be reviewed with the therapist, who will attempt to interpret the dream’s symbolic meanings.</p> <p id="XDNXVVMCS2VJ7UY5A889" id-sequence="311">In addition to reviewing the content of free association, dreams, and Freudian slips, the analyst looks for signs of transference and resistance. <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1339" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1339"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1339" id="SYTNH2Y25VNQS33WL590" id-sequence="312"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Transference</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="LYRFZ4B6H26MWBA08926" id-sequence="313">Transference</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A psychoanalytic technique in which the therapist uses the responses of the patient to the therapist to understand the patient’s approach to authority figures in general.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1339">

Resistance, for the psychoanalyst, can be expressed in many forms.

As mentioned previously in this chapter, the psychoanalyst takes a powerful, directive role reminiscent of an MD. The individual seeking therapy is identified as a patient. As in the medical setting, the therapist identifies the nature of the patient’s problems and prescribes a course of action. Other than supplying information, the patient plays a relatively passive role in the process. In contrast, the humanistic therapist is nondirective and treats the person seeking therapy, called a “client” instead of a patient, as more of an equal in the process.

Empathic therapists attempt to see the world through the eyes of the client, as opposed to imposing their own worldviews. Allowing the client to feel understood in this manner contributes to the establishment of a safe, supportive environment where natural growth can occur. Unconditional positive regard, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>, also contributes to the safety of the therapeutic setting. Rogers believed that much human unhappiness resulted from conditional regard, in which children learn that they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to an authority figure. The nonjudgmental, unconditional positive regard of the therapy setting is designed to compensate for those earlier, potentially damaging experiences.</p> <p id="ZGAMPBZ93XUW2AZU5370" id-sequence="340">Reflection techniques consist of the therapist restating some of the client’s comments in a way that conveys understanding. As such, reflection contributes to empathy and the client’s sense of being fully understood. For example, a client might state that he felt helpless when his boss reprimanded him for losing an important account. The therapist might simply comment, “You sound like you were very angry and frustrated when your boss yelled at you.” Clarification allows the therapist to point out important insights that the client might have reached. The therapist might clarify the situation with the boss by pointing out its similarities with the feelings that we have as children when we are corrected by an adult.</p> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="PSXT49Z3XDCB89RC6946" id-sequence="341"><div class="sidebarContent" id="PSXT49Z3XDCB89RC6946_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="342"> <p id="MNGBEFZZY2ZBU83GD889" id-sequence="343">Reflecting feelings takes practice to avoid sounding silly or reverting to the cliché “I hear what you’re saying,” but you might give it a try the next time someone confronts you. Reflecting the other person’s feelings instead of focusing on your own helps you stay calm, and it’s hard to carry on a one-sided argument with a calm person.</p> </div></div> <p id="SGRJRV6Q3D2HBRK5V243" id-sequence="344">Even when psychotherapists use therapy techniques other than a person-centered approach, they frequently incorporate some or all of Rogers’s communication strategies, such as reflection. These strategies also have become quite popular in programs designed to improve interpersonal communication and group process. For example, it is not uncommon for teens to stomp into the house and declare that they “hate” their parents. The typical response of the parents at that point is to become hurt and angry. The argument escalates as one of the parents retaliates with a hurtful statement, perhaps “I wish you were never born!” Rogers suggests that such immature battles are easily avoided. Instead of retaliating, the parent might say, “I know it makes you very angry when I restrict your privileges, but we had a deal, you broke it, and that means there will be consequences.” Reflecting another’s emotions in this way may increase the chances of defusing needless hostility and of coming to a mutual understanding because people will know more concretely that they are “being heard.”</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_609" data-page="609"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17a8 rs_skip" id="ZWKKC5M4KXUDXXJYC255" clrenderdata="[&quot;FBYSGJQR6Q1RBXNV8444&quot;]" id-sequence="345"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf19-t2.jpg" data-width="505" data-height="254" data-alt="According to the humanistic psychologists, people who learn they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to authority figures can benefit from a therapy setting that features unconditional positive regard."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="SJNRS8D68ZVH89G7G762" id-sequence="346"><p>According to the humanistic psychologists, people who learn they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to authority figures can benefit from a therapy setting that features unconditional positive regard.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:505px;height:254px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf19-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="According to the humanistic psychologists, people who learn they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to authority figures can benefit from a therapy setting that features unconditional positive regard." width="505" height="254" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">wincott/ <a target="_blank" id="TAYJL8Y2TZL2YTLD0715" name="TAYJL8Y2TZL2YTLD0715" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="347">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="PWHWC2GNF739FNUX4682" id-sequence="348">Like psychoanalysis, humanistic approaches to therapy work better in some instances than in others. Rogers referred to his approach as “counseling,” and his techniques are better suited to problems of adjustment than cases of serious disorders, such as schizophrenia. Efforts to assess the outcomes of humanistic therapy scientifically have been rejected by its followers. For example, one group of proponents argued that “natural science methodology should not be privileged over human science methodology” (Bohart, O’Hara, &amp; Leitner, 1998, p. 141). By now, you probably understand that we would reject this suggestion and argue instead that science is science, regardless of the phenomenon being examined.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="349"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="352"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="353" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="354" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="PVHNZ01GR5TL1BA6C082" id-sequence="355"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">15-3</span> <span class="headingText">Contemporary Approaches to Psychotherapy</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="SNXG1ZWQKKL92SDCC399_content" id-sequence="356"> <p id="PFXJ8QLJ0SNWKC2TP387" id-sequence="357">Although a small minority of psychotherapists continue to use Freudian or humanistic approaches, most contemporary therapists use other methods.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="358"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="361"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="362" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="363" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="EWLJ96NU3VMXS3PFW251" id-sequence="364"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">15-3a</span> <span class="headingText">Behavioral Therapies</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="DYFAK8VUJ5G2XNKUZ161_content" id-sequence="365"> <p id="VFEMHYAPXNWYU3ACT419" id-sequence="366">Freud’s psychodynamic theory, humanistic theory, and behaviorism were among the most dominant influences in psychology during the 20th century. We have seen how psychodynamic and humanistic theories were applied to psychotherapy in the form of psychoanalysis and Rogers’s person-centered therapy, so it should come as no surprise to find that behaviorism has similar applications. Given our formal definition of learning as “a relatively permanent change in behavior or the capacity for behavior due to experience,” it seems logical to use learning as a way to increase the frequency of desirable behaviors and decrease unwanted behaviors in the therapy setting.</p> <p id="UCHVJQG2GW13V45XG777" id-sequence="367"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf133c" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133c"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133c" id="KFMWLCS6KHSXE5WN8951" id-sequence="368"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Behavior therapies</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="CDTASX756E9R6590E357" id-sequence="369">Behavior therapies</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Applications of classical and operant conditioning principles to the treatment of symptoms of psychological disorder and adjustment problems</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133c">

</span> represent applications of classical and operant conditioning to problems of adjustment and psychological disorders. These techniques have proved helpful in both reducing unwanted behaviors and increasing the frequency of desirable behaviors over a range of psychological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. The first book to use the term <em>behavior modification</em> in its title was Leonard Ullman and Leonard Krasner’s <em>Case Studies in Behavior Modification</em>, published in 1965. The public initially distrusted behavioral treatment methods because they were based on animal research and assumed that human behavior was relatively simple. The mysticism of the psychoanalysts’ unconscious drives and impulses seemed far more romantic. However, when behavior<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_610" data-page="610"></a> modification produced successful results in cases that were previously considered untreatable, such as in ASD, respect for the approach grew.</p> <p id="JRDBEFCBK5M7K3RAM991" id-sequence="370">Like behaviorism in general, behavior modification, now known as <em>applied behavior analysis (ABA)</em>, focuses on what can be observed and makes few assumptions about such unseen factors as the unconscious mind. We can contrast the way that Freud and a therapist using ABA might approach Freud’s case of Little Hans, a 5-year-old boy who had a phobia of horses (Freud, 1909/1976). For Freud, Hans’s phobia resulted from the Oedipus complex issues that were supposedly at their height at his age. Horses, Freud argued, symbolized Hans’s father. The boy had noted that he was especially frightened of horses with black bits in their mouths, which Freud suggested represented the father’s mustache. Freud concluded that Hans’s fear of horses resulted from his unconscious fear of retaliation by the father for sexual fantasies about his mother and would disappear with the resolution of Hans’s Oedipus complex.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17a9 rs_skip" id="WKNQTZTZU1CFPP6LC249" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZMBWHR15WMYCTDDYZ905&quot;]" id-sequence="371"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf20-t2.jpg" data-width="232" data-height="276" data-alt="The subject of Freud’s famous case study of “Little Hans” was actually named Herbert Graf.

According to classical conditioning theory, phobias can result from conditioned fears. In Hans’s day, horses were the most frequently used means of transportation, especially in large cities. Accidents involving horses were frequent and quite serious. Hans related that he was frightened of horses falling—and with good reason, because it is likely that viewing such accidents would be quite traumatic. Horses could become classically conditioned fear stimuli through their association with accidents and the resulting fear. To reduce the fear, Hans could be gradually exposed to horses in a safe environment (desensitization), rewarded for approaching horses (counterconditioning), or allowed to play with a group of children interacting with a horse (peer modeling). It is not necessary to know why Hans fears the horses to apply behavioral treatment successfully.</p> <p id="WHQZCCNDXTPJDM5A4795" id-sequence="374">ABA has been used frequently to reduce unwanted habits. For example, let us suppose that Jennifer would like to stop smoking. The behavior therapist begins by evaluating Jennifer’s current behavior by observing the circumstances in which she smokes. Based on these observations, the therapist might note that Jennifer rarely smokes alone. Instead, her smoking is quite social. If she is at a party or with friends who are smoking, she smokes. The therapist also takes notes of reinforcers or punishers that might be influencing the behavior. Perhaps Jennifer’s friends praise her when she smokes, but her parents get angry when they notice evidence of her smoking. Jennifer’s dentist also might warn her about the poor state of her oral hygiene, which smoking only worsens.</p> <p id="NKVNLQA86ZZXKVJ80014" id-sequence="375">Based on these observations, the behavior therapist might attempt a number of techniques that will separate Jennifer from high-risk situations for smoking. She might be encouraged either to gain the support of her friends for her efforts to quit smoking or to spend more<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_611" data-page="611"></a> time with her nonsmoking friends. Jennifer’s parents might be willing to provide some incentives for her to quit smoking. She could set aside the money that she normally spends on cigarettes for some special treat. Counterconditioning, in the form of asking Jennifer to smoke until she feels sick, is an unpleasant but effective strategy (<span class="citation" id="HUUA3XPHSY64VRZPH891" id-sequence="376">Lichtenstein, Harris, Birchler, Wahl, &amp; Schmahl, 1973</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17aa rs_skip" id="MHDQC7RG1QGQBG14G992" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZEPKSW38M3FFBBPSH130&quot;]" id-sequence="377"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf21-t2.jpg" data-width="592" data-height="233" data-alt="A photo shows a woman wearing a virtual reality, where she sees a spider.

According to <span class="citation" id="TJLPG0CJDCNY1ZSGB002" id-sequence="394"> Beck (1975)</span>, people run into psychological trouble when they adopt irrational, self-defeating ways of thinking. For example, it is unrealistic to think that other people will always treat you fairly and kindly, or that you must be perfect to be loved. An important aspect of the therapy process occurs when the therapist attempts to change the irrational beliefs of the client. For example, let’s assume that a therapist is trying to help a group of students who suffer from test anxiety. Each student has an irrational belief that he or she is going to flunk out of school, despite having an adequate grade point average. To help the students realize that this belief is irrational, the therapist might ask each one to provide evidence of the likelihood of flunking out or to identify the worst possible outcome of giving up the belief. Faced with logic, each student begins to substitute a new, rational belief for the old, irrational belief. This substitution of rational for irrational beliefs is termed <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf133d" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133d"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133d" id="KGNX6R5RFCJTCYRJE671" id-sequence="395"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">cognitive restructuring</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="CBKMHJKH9WU1AJW0Y235" id-sequence="396">cognitive restructuring</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A technique used in cognitive therapies in which new, rational beliefs replace earlier, irrational beliefs held by the client.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf133d">

Ellis retained the need to produce cognitive restructuring but deemphasized the supportive role of the therapist.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ad rs_skip" id="BUAT3BRLM9BY6XUVL626" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZFYVQJXLCTNLLUYAE980&quot;]" id-sequence="402"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf23-t2.jpg" data-width="227" data-height="276" data-alt="Aaron Beck (1921–), shown here addressing a workshop at the Beck Institute, developed one of the earliest types of cognitive therapies.

Walter Freeman popularized the procedure in the United States, traveling in a vehicle that he called his “lobotomobile.” John Fulton, whose research with chimpanzees had formed the basis for Freeman’s operation, was horrified. “What are these terrible things I hear about you doing lobotomies in your office with an ice pick?” he asked Freeman. “Why not use a shotgun?” (<span class="citation" id="CKAWFRLHZ2T201M3D747" id-sequence="477">Kopell, Machado, &amp; Rezai, 2005</span>, p. 192).</p> <p id="YWDSJFAJFATSNXF93628" id-sequence="478">As we have emphasized in several contexts in this textbook, the frontal lobes participate in some of the highest-order cognitive functions carried out by the human brain.

</span> is a type of biofeedback that concentrates on the activity of the brain. Recordings of brain activity, usually obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) but increasingly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are usually displayed for the participant, who is trained to keep readings in a desired range. In most cases, people are not consciously aware of what they are doing to comply. So far, however, rigorous studies have not provided strong support for the efficacy of EEG neurofeedback in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and MDD (Begemann, Florisse, van Lutterveld, Kooyman, &amp; Sommer, 2016). Consequently, few insurance providers will cover this type of treatment.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_616" data-page="616"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_summary narrative

Subjective observations might lead us to think that computers—or better yet, mobile devices like tablets and smartphones—would be perfect for this purpose. But do the results of scientific research demonstrate true benefits?</p> <p id="QURTXMQX5555SG146954" id-sequence="659">The answer, happily, appears to be “yes” (<span class="citation" id="TATAY5NUZZF75DGXA912" id-sequence="660">Kagohara et al., 2013</span>). A review of 15 studies carefully selected based on the strength of their methodology demonstrated that mobile technologies have advantages for the person with ASD. The most frequent uses of mobile technology were using the device to access preferred stimuli, such as snacks and toys, which might otherwise be difficult for individuals with language delays. In cases of severe language disability, the devices could generate speech that would allow the individual to request preferred stimuli.</p> <p id="BJLN7BDMNFH0MH1CM919" id-sequence="661">Other uses included videos that teach specific academic skills, such as how to use the spell-check function of a word processing program. Video modeling of skills can be useful, given the reluctance to engage in face-to-face instruction that characterizes this disorder. Using an iPad to improve math skills produced mixed results (O’Malley, Lewis, Donehower, &amp; Stone, 2014). However, students in this study who used the math app were more likely to complete their work with fewer prompts on the part of the teacher.</p> <p id="MUCGA8FJ2J3BNPJ9G774" id-sequence="662">Technology also offers potential relief from the high cost of face-to-face applied behavior analysis (ABA) treatment in cases of ASD. Randomized trials are currently underway using an iPad-based behavioral intervention called TOBY (<span class="citation" id="NJGJ43EDK1P9CFMB2247" id-sequence="663">Granich et al., 2016</span>), which is intended to compliment, not replace, conventional therapy.</p> <p id="HPADDRXMC0P9FF6Q1037" id-sequence="664">The overall advantages of using these technologies include people’s ability to advance at their own pace with minimal supervision. At the same time, use of the devices should not substitute for face-to-face contact because such interaction is essential to improvements in behavior in individuals with ASD. However, social skills themselves might be the object of mobile apps. The evaluations of apps specifically designed to enhance children’s creative, expressive, and collaborative social activities seem encouraging, but the use of apps for this purpose needs further study (<span class="citation" id="QNUQ58BKYH2FXKD81887" id-sequence="665">Hourcade, Williams, Miller, Huebner, &amp; Liang, 2013</span>). </p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ba rs_skip" id="KKHM8QCKJNFZVA9A7613" clrenderdata="[&quot;GWVH9V29BAFTDSA5Z227&quot;]" id-sequence="666"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf33-t2.jpg" data-width="306" data-height="251" data-alt="Photo shows a lady teaching a school going boy with ASD by showing him things on a tablet."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="HNWSPKN1SXHBE41AH191" id-sequence="667"><p>Research supports the use of tablets and other mobile technologies for improving the skills and behaviors of children with ASD.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:306px;height:251px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_15_unf33-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Photo shows a lady teaching a school going boy with ASD by showing him things on a tablet." width="306" height="251" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Boston Globe/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> </div></div> <p id="MQADTAC1446X34B27271" id-sequence="668">Because of the severity and lifelong nature of ASD, parents of children with this disorder are especially vulnerable to so-called cures that have little research support. Dietary interventions have become popular in recent years, but these appear to have few benefits. People with ASD show evidence of excess peptides from gluten (found in wheat) and casein (found in dairy products), but controlled studies do not demonstrate benefits from restricting these foods (Millward, Ferriter, Calver, &amp; Connell-Jones, 2008). “Chelation” treatments designed to remove heavy metals from the body are also popular but lack research support (<span class="citation" id="DUPTV9JYN2G0SXFT5391" id-sequence="669">Weber &amp; Newmark, 2007</span>).

These drugs increase the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine. Most patients tolerate these medications well, but side effects of weight loss, sleep disturbance, and higher heart rate and blood pressure can occur. If children take the medications continuously for long periods, growth can also be suppressed. Methylphenidate does produce tolerance, and patients should stop the drug under medical supervision rather than on their own (<span class="citation" id="RNLEPFYDX3NKACXQ8903" id-sequence="678">Ross, Fischhoff, &amp; Davenport, 2002</span>).

Wouldn’t it make more sense to try medications that have a calming effect? The rationale for stimulant treatment of ADHD suggests that impulsive hyperactivity occurs if the parts of the brain responsible for planned, thoughtful behavior, such as the basal ganglia and frontal lobes, are not active enough. Raising the activity in these areas theoretically should reduce impulsive behavior. One of the common myths about medications for ADHD, however, is that they are ineffective in people who do not have the disorder. This is not the case, and medications prescribed for ADHD are commonly abused (<span class="citation" id="AZEJJ5J4AFGRR51L9868" id-sequence="684">Arnsten, 2006</span>).</p> <p id="CGZWDL439Y0KJ0ZA1456" id-sequence="685">The use of medication for ADHD in the United States is five times higher than in any other nation, leading to criticism of the practice (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TUNL7HYP1TKBE2F0L188" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-section-id="DTKWF7A8HZ7U7D8HP776" data-element-id="TUNL7HYP1TKBE2F0L188">Figure 15.11</a>).

Patients were often subjected to odd “treatments” that had no basis in any scientific understanding of their condition and that were frankly dangerous in some cases. They were forcibly restrained in lukewarm baths with canvas covers that prevented their escape. Insulin shock therapy, in<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_621" data-page="621"></a> which injections of insulin were used to place patients in daily comas, enjoyed a brief fad status, as did the frontal lobotomy, discussed earlier in this chapter.</p> <p id="PADA5GVUAEDGZA9MR881" id-sequence="709">The discovery of effective medications for schizophrenia was accidental.

Based on his promising results, Laborit encouraged his psychiatric colleagues to try the drug on their psychotic patients, which they did with dramatic success. A new era of treatment began. Largely as a result of this new type of treatment, institutionalized populations dropped by about 50% in the United States between 1955 and 2000 (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="GVLBK13LYM5N6UBUH652" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-section-id="BEPX3XFPPWENXZ60G721" data-element-id="GVLBK13LYM5N6UBUH652">Figure 15.12</a>).

By the mid-1960s, enough barbiturates were being made to provide every American man, woman, and child with 40 to 50 doses per year (<span class="citation" id="PEUFZWDBQCA4W519P278" id-sequence="840">Regan, 2000</span>).

By the 1970s, chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) were the most frequently prescribed drugs of their day. Alprazolam (Xanax) remains a widely used benzodiazepine, typically prescribed for panic disorder, GAD, and premenstrual syndrome. In some cases, alprazolam seems to be helpful in treating MDD, but its mechanism for doing so is not understood.</p> <p id="HYGGSEV471VJ6C9UL387" id-sequence="842">You might think that tranquilizers would be a logical medication for treating anxiety disorders.

These same techniques are often implemented to produce relaxation during exposure therapy.</p> <p id="DDQS0LVVB72KJ7G9B554" id-sequence="858">To enhance your ability to relax, it is often beneficial to make an audio recording of the instructions. To begin, put on some loose, comfortable clothing and either lie down on your back or sit in a chair with your head supported. Breathe slowly and deeply. Each muscle group is tensed for 5 seconds (silently count “one–one thousand” at a normal speaking pace), followed by a pause of 20 seconds, during which you relax the muscle group and think of tension “draining” from that part of the body. The procedure can be repeated for more dramatic relaxation. With practice, you should be able to “will” yourself into a relaxed state rather easily.

Some psychotherapists work on the assumption that dissociative identity disorder is a valid diagnostic category that often results from serious trauma (childhood sexual abuse in particular). Treatment is aimed toward integrating the various personalities by first identifying and “working through” the traumatic memories related to the disorder (International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2015). Hypnosis is commonly used by these therapists to assist in the recovery and resolution of traumatic memories, but this practice is not supported by scientific research. Under hypnosis, a suggestible person might be vulnerable to the manufacture of false memories, and individuals identified as having dissociative identity disorder appear to be far more suggestible than the general public (<span class="citation" id="FUKR9M6NRQM81TRYF445" id-sequence="924">Frischholz, Lipman, Braun, &amp; Sachs, 1992</span>). In one notable case study, a woman sought therapy to cope with a traumatic event involving her daughter. Her psychiatrist employed hypnosis and convinced her that she had experienced horrific abuse as a child and now had more than 120 separate personalities (including one that was a duck), thereby illustrating the influence that therapists can have on the “memories” that they help recover (<span class="citation" id="WHPAZUHSZKB65BCY9518" id-sequence="925">Loftus, 1997</span>).</p> <p id="MSYC7E13WHZ2QM635551" id-sequence="926">A particularly damaging finding regarding the state of treatment for dissociative identity disorder is the suggestion that individuals labeled with the disorder subsequently show even worse symptoms (<span class="citation" id="WHKEKL4YWCK7DWQPE090" id-sequence="927">Piper &amp; Merskey, 2004</span>).

Outcomes using DBT for borderline personality disorder appear superior to those produced by more conventional treatments with CBT (<span class="citation" id="ZGJNBBYQ8V7MZM0JM812" id-sequence="981">Linehan et al., 2006</span>).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="982"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="985"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="986" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="987" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="NZCYXHVBKAH7SM97S430" id-sequence="988"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">15-5n</span> <span class="headingText">Integration of Specific Treatments</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="CAMKAXHGYNP1D1YZ0432_content" id-sequence="989"> <p id="EXUTTKCEW5MPWTZ5N020" id-sequence="990">Perhaps after reading about the variations in both the biological and psychological treatments available for specific types of disorders, you will better appreciate why people who want to be therapists spend such a long time in school perfecting their skills and learning about their options.</p> <p id="HQSDZAP79ZU8PBMW4196" id-sequence="991">Although some disorders seem to defy the available treatment methods, we do not want to leave you with the impression that therapy is somehow ineffective. Quite the contrary is true. Compared to the state of available therapies as recently as 60 years ago, psychologists and psychiatrists have made great strides in their ability to alleviate the distress of many millions of people. As we learn more about the causal factors underlying these disorders, as we surely will by pursuing integrative approaches, our abilities to help will expand. At the same time, we are making significant progress in our understanding about the prevention of many of these disorders, which we hope will make these problems a thing of the past.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ca rs_skip" id="LJHH8K840E9RTRTNW183" clrenderdata="[&quot;LCAF65RYNSKUDHHQ0911&quot;]" id-sequence="992"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_unf41-t2.png" data-width="509" data-height="430" data-alt="Screenshots of a smartphone app are shown.

Most couples get along during the good times—it’s often the tough times that test the quality of the relationship. The Gottmans equip couples with simple measures of heart rate as they discuss areas of conflict. This approach is based on their observations that unhappy couples experience much higher levels of sympathetic arousal than happy couples do during conflict. If the measures get too high, the couple is instructed to take a break in the discussion. The general idea is that you can’t solve problems if your levels of arousal are too high, and continuing conflict under these circumstances is destructive.</p> <p id="NPUFPQ88F8ML33QDS495" id-sequence="1004">The first step asks the couple to postpone any efforts at persuasion until each person has clarified his or her position. The focus is on self-disclosure, not “attack–defend.” A second step involves “reprocessing” past emotional injuries. Couples are guided through five steps with regard to processing past hurts: feelings they had, subjective realities, triggers, taking responsibility and apologizing, and constructive plans. Finally, in the Gottmans’ lab work, they realized that couples raised the same conflicts at 3-year, 6-year, and 9-year intervals! To integrate this concept with their counseling, they worked with couples to accept each partner’s personality (often the source of long-term conflict) and the ideal solutions imagined by each partner. While not removing the problem, the couples could learn to live with it.</p> <p id="XMWUF27BCLUDMMC85755" id-sequence="1005">The Gottmans’ work in the lab has provided them with unique, scientific tools for helping people build more effective relationships with their partners, and even their children. Observations a few months after a wedding predicted the couple’s happiness with their first-born. Data from the last trimester of pregnancy predicted the frequency of a baby’s laughing, smiling, or crying. A 10-hour seminar over 2 days reversed relationship dissatisfaction in 77% of last-trimester couples, an effect replicated now in 24 countries. It is hard to imagine a better use of psychological science than to intervene positively in the happiness of these couples and their children.</p> </div></div><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_634" data-page="634"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologytakesonrealworldproblems narrative  rs_skip" id="LXDWHY36GJ4WXGKEY112" label="psychologytakesonrealworldproblems" id-sequence="1006"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Psychology Takes on Real-World Problems</span><h3 id="VJTNW6FTL4URBT5FB682" id-sequence="1007">What Do We Do with a Cyberbully?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="LXDWHY36GJ4WXGKEY112_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1008"> <p id="HSAD3H66EL76DJV3B168" id-sequence="1009">In <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">chapter 14</a>, we described cyberbullies as being somewhat different from traditional bullies, in that the traditional bullies evidenced Dark Triad traits (Machiavellianism, narcissicim, and psychopathy), but these traits were not predictive of cyberbullying. Instead, cyberbullies were characterized by higher levels of sadism, or taking pleasure in the pain of others. Prior to 1994, “sadistic personality disorder” was included in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</em>, but it is no longer. As a result, relatively little recent psychological research has focused on this behavior, and the research that does exist focuses on sexual sadism. We can assume that the basic features of sadism have been incorporated into the <em>DSM</em> category of ASPD, yet van Geel et al. (2017) were able to distinguish between psychopathy (closely related to ASPD) and sadism.</p> <p id="YMTXTG2JTLHJ0P57T099" id-sequence="1010">Sadism is described as having “theoretical roots completely divorced from the Dark Triad of personality” (<span class="citation" id="HCUQHK6ETUS3DW0ZZ330" id-sequence="1011">Paulhus, Jones, Boyle, Saklofske, &amp; Matthews, 2015</span>, p. 582), yet it also is part of what the authors refer to as “social toxic personalities,” along with sensational interests and amoralism. The Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies (VAST) measure used by van Geel et al. (2017) to study bullies shows independence from Dark Triad traits in statistical analyses and predicts undergraduates’ willingness to crunch bugs in a machine or apply white noise blasts to innocent victims. The instrument also identifies a person’s willingness to engage in vicarious sadism, which, of course, is relevant to the bystanders of cyberbulling and those who share the content produced by their friends.</p> <p id="ENREPAQ2UL046K467042" id-sequence="1012">Because of the relative neglect of the topic of nonsexual sadism in the scientific literature, even less is known about interventions that might prove useful. As noted earlier in this chapter in the section on treating ASPD, this type of problem can be highly resistant to treatment. We might hypothesize that the type of sadism seen in cyberbullies also would be resistant to change. Because personality disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood, it is possible that empathy interventions might be somewhat effective with younger cyberbullies.</p> <p id="RPHCKHM7HH1BMKK03658" id-sequence="1013">If empathy cannot be established, it is possible that the behavior can be managed using simple learning principles, as described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>. Researchers have looked at the consequences in place for cyberbullying and the cyberbullies’ perception of the likelihood of experiencing those consequences (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="NCYL6V77H0CZQ075R604" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-section-id="CAMKAXHGYNP1D1YZ0432" data-element-id="NCYL6V77H0CZQ075R604">Figure 15.20</a>). Many states have passed or updated laws in an effort to combat cyberbullying, and police are becoming more likely to be involved. Surveys of middle school students, however, report that they are more deterred by the threat of punishment from their parents and school than the threat of punishment by police (<span class="citation" id="HDFE9VVNGYF4PUZCD264" id-sequence="1014">Patchin &amp; Hinduja, 2016</span>). A total of 75% of a group of middle school students believed that the cyberbullies described in six scenarios would face some type of consequence for their behavior (<span class="citation" id="MEQGCXU8RP7QVGMYU650" id-sequence="1015">Pettalia, Levin, &amp; Dickinson, 2013</span>). At the same time, students rated the harm done by cyberbullying as much higher than the likelihood of consequences for the perpetrator. Encouraging students to report incidents of cyberbullying, which they may not because they think that “nothing will happen” and because they fear retaliation, and publicizing the administration of consequences might help reduce the prevalence of cyberbullying. A more reliable solution, however, would be to undermine whatever gains in social status cyberbullies enjoy that continue to positively reinforce their behavior. </p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17cc rs_skip" id="NCYL6V77H0CZQ075R604" clrenderdata="[&quot;WMUY1HUMGHGE341W4865&quot;]" id-sequence="1016"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_15_f20-t2.png" data-width="419" data-height="169" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the percentage of middle school children believing a consequence is likely in traditional bullying and cyberbullying.

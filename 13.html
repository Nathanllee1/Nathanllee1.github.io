These causal factors interact with one another in complex ways, so the same disorder might look one way in one individual and quite different in another.

Instead, we are looking at a visual representation of something that biologists call an <em>interactome</em>—a map of all interactions among proteins in a cell.

Psychologists point out that we say “a person with autism spectrum disorder” instead of an “autistic person” for good reason. People are not their disorders, and much is happening in each individual’s life that has nothing to do with ASD.

In Latin, the prefix <em>ab</em> means “away from” and <em>norma</em> means “the rule.” In other words, abnormal behavior is literally behavior that is not typical, usual, or regular. This meaning implies a statistical definition of abnormality. By this definition, behaviors that most people do are normal, whereas behaviors that characterize a minority of people are abnormal.</p> <p id="GGAE2Y1SS6WW26KPM778" id-sequence="87">This statistical approach has the advantage of being clear (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="WLYFVLRKL5CX64SEF706" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-section-id="HXBAX5D2M2QYHCW30313" data-element-id="WLYFVLRKL5CX64SEF706">Figure 14.2</a>). For example, intellectual disability is one of the categories in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, a handbook for diagnosis that we discuss in more detail later in the chapter. The diagnosis of intellectual disability relies heavily on statistics. A score of 70 or below on a standard IQ test is the typical cutoff for identifying an individual with intellectual disability (APA, 2013). Even in this relatively clear situation, however, the statistical approach represents merely a starting point. A diagnosis of intellectual disability also requires an individual to demonstrate difficulties with adaptive skills, which include factors such as communication, self-care, safety, and use of community resources.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1752 rs_skip" id="WLYFVLRKL5CX64SEF706" clrenderdata="[&quot;VMEVKD4R77A3MLTFY024&quot;]" id-sequence="88"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_14_f02-t3.png" data-width="614" data-height="338"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_f02-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="326" data-alt="A normal distribution curve represents Wechsler I Q scores. 68.26% of the people have an I Q score between 85 and 115 with 100 being the mean I Q score. 27.18% have an I Q score between 70 and 85 or between 115 and 130.

Academy Award–winning producer Quentin Tarantino (<em>Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Django Unchained</em>, and <em>The Hateful Eight</em>) has a reported IQ of 160.

First, it implies a cultural specificity that we would like to avoid. Because most members of one culture may behave in ways different from those of people in another, the purely statistical approach to abnormality might result in different definitions of psychological disorder from one culture to the next. Second, a statistical definition fails to capture the distress that often accompanies a psychological disorder, both for the person experiencing the disorder and for those interacting with that person.</p> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="MTYU24N5SPNM4EZGS532" id-sequence="92"><div class="sidebarContent" id="MTYU24N5SPNM4EZGS532_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="93"> <p id="VMAX3H3PS4CRQ3R1X860" id-sequence="94">Our tolerance for people engaging in acts that are harmful to themselves is variable.

This approach succeeds in capturing the general distress that most of us experience when observing or experiencing abnormal behavior. Unfortunately, this approach does nothing to avoid cross-cultural differences in defining disordered behavior. Different cultures are often characterized by diverse ideals. In Western nations, hearing voices that others cannot hear is generally considered abnormal. In other cultures, hearing voices may be viewed more positively, as a sign of religious giftedness (Al-Issa, 1977; <span class="citation" id="AZZAG09UH0C5MWYGN530" id-sequence="96"> Kurihara, Kato, Sakamoto, Reverger, &amp; Kitamura, 2000</span>). More troublesome is the simple fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, to reach consensus regarding what constitutes ideal behavior. People, including experts in psychology, have deeply divided<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_549" data-page="549"></a> value judgments regarding sexual conduct, recreational drug use, and a host of other activities.</p> <p id="YEUK06TL8YU8TT8KC678" id-sequence="97">A simple modification of this “deviation from the ideal” approach can help us to achieve some consensus. Behaviors that cause harm to others are viewed as less than ideal. Unless the person is acting defensively, most of us would agree that such behavior is negative and undesirable. We are also sympathetic to those who have conditions that cause harm to themselves.</p> <p id="KRRTT6CMUJRMQH38R122" id-sequence="98">We don’t know how many people have psychological disorders.

Just as a person who is diagnosed with depression might show low levels of serotonin activity in the brain, being in a leadership position boosts a person’s serotonin levels. A simple biological explanation suggesting that chemical imbalances lead to depression, or a simple psychological explanation stating that people who feel powerless are more likely to be depressed, misses the nuances of these reciprocal relationships. The richer understanding of the causal factors leading to a psychological disorder pays off in the development of more effective treatments. Single-perspective thinking usually leads to single-perspective treatments. If you believe that depression is purely the result of chemical imbalances of the brain, then a simple prescription should do the trick. If you believe that hearing voices that others can’t hear is the result of childhood communication patterns, you will miss the opportunity to provide medication that can effectively end these troubling symptoms. Inclusive models describing the entire range of causal factors are more likely to result in effective treatments tailored to the needs of individuals.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="148"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="151"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="152" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="153" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="MBUUU2JFU1RAU0BQB157" id-sequence="154"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">14-4</span> <span class="headingText">Which Disorders Emerge in Childhood?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="ZPAZBFWJJCLPG901J930_content" id-sequence="155"> <p id="CWZKT35HC4ENSMESY478" id-sequence="156">Many disorders might have roots in childhood but are more typically diagnosed in adolescence and adulthood.

ASD represents a spectrum because the severity of the observed deficits can vary widely from individual to individual.

Beginning in infancy, most children with ASD do not make eye contact or take pleasure in reciprocal games like peekaboo. Insight into the thoughts and points of view of others is particularly lacking. As discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-element-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415">Chapter 11</a>, children develop a theory of mind by the time they are 3–4 years of age. Many researchers believe that a failure to develop a normal theory of mind is responsible for many of the social deficits observed in ASD (Baron-Cohen, 1991; <span class="citation" id="AKWRDX7V2VWS647XS551" id-sequence="177"> Senju, Southgate, White, &amp; Frith, 2009</span>). Language skills of individuals with ASD can vary widely, from having no<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_553" data-page="553"></a> language abilities to delayed acquisition of language to normal skills (<span class="citation" id="YZPC4V4G2NM2EX5AR647" id-sequence="178">Ellis Weismer, Lord, &amp; Esler, 2010</span>). Even when language skills are relatively normal, though, individuals with ASD usually experience difficulty maintaining conversations with others because of their social skills deficits.</p> <p id="DJYGZ96FQYCJCJVJC856" id-sequence="179">Individuals with ASD often object strenuously to changes in their environments and show a high level of repetitive, routine behavior. Rituals may include repetitive movements, such as rocking, hand flapping, head banging, and twirling. Other individuals may engage in extremely limited preoccupations, such as learning all models of cars ever made by Ford. One possible source of this ritualistic behavior is a general dysfunction in sensory networks. Most individuals with ASD show unusually increased or decreased sensitivity to stimuli (Lane, Young, Baker, &amp; Angley, 2010). They may be relatively insensitive to pain or cold but distressed by normal sound levels (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TCJTU30287GT2JTMA816" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-section-id="UHRNJWP1111SN3A4S019" data-element-id="TCJTU30287GT2JTMA816">Figure 14.5</a>).

Hundreds of genes are probably involved, and research attention is focusing on the expression of these genes during brain development (<span class="citation" id="BCDDZFXTEYXUFBGG3825" id-sequence="188">Sakai et al., 2011</span>; <span class="citation" id="RJNW06AZ196667UB6271" id-sequence="189"> Vorstman et al., 2017</span>).

In the typical control brains, 174 genes were expressed differently in the frontal lobes than in the temporal lobes, but in the brains of people with ASD, no gene showed evidence of being expressed differently in these two areas.</p> <p id="XLWRPGE8DG5V9F8W1243" id-sequence="191">Abnormalities in cortical development might lead to unusual minicolumns, vertical arrays of neurons perpendicular to the surface of the cerebral cortex that represent the smallest<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_554" data-page="554"></a> processing units of the brain. Individuals with ASD have narrower minicolumns containing normal numbers of cells, but spaced farther apart than those found in healthy individuals. These structural differences are consistent with a pattern of connectivity that favors detailed focus, which could produce the unusual interests and hobbies of people with ASD, over more global processing, like understanding the social environment (<span class="citation" id="UURU0X3U4Y1LQ2QYB348" id-sequence="192">Opris &amp; Casanova, 2014</span>).</p> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="VYKK7GZ4H5WAN2DHH019" id-sequence="193"><div class="sidebarContent" id="VYKK7GZ4H5WAN2DHH019_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="194"> <p id="JEPXJDPRB0GFDMQN4650" id-sequence="195">Narrow minicolumns similar to those found in the brains of people with ASD were observed in the brains of three distinguished scientists, none of whom had ASD symptoms, who donated their brains for scientific study.

Some individuals show both inattention and hyperactivity, but others show inattention without hyperactivity or vice versa (APA, 2013). The core feature of inattention is the inability to maintain sustained attention or on-task behavior for an age-appropriate length of time. This problem is evidenced in the diagnostic criteria for inattention, such as difficulties in following instructions, in organizing and completing work, and in avoiding careless mistakes. Children<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_556" data-page="556"></a> with hyperactivity express a high level of motor activity and find engaging in structured activities, such as waiting in line or sitting quietly in class, challenging. These children are noisy, active, and boisterous, and they often appear to take action without thinking it through.

Schizophrenia also features negative symptoms (APA, 2013). Negative symptoms are behaviors that are seen in healthy people but not in patients. These symptoms include “diminished emotional expression and avolition” (APA, 2013, p. 88). A person with diminished emotional expression does not show typical outward signs of emotion, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, when an emotional response is expected.

</span> are false perceptions. Although hallucinations may occur in several sensory modalities, most hallucinations in schizophrenia are auditory (<span class="citation" id="BEDR3NSJ84BVR6A5M881" id-sequence="348">Tien, 1991</span>). Patients often report hearing voices, which can be accusatory or otherwise unpleasant, contributing to the distress associated with the disorder. Auditory hallucinations are not imaginary; they are real sensations correlated with increased activity in the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe (<span class="citation" id="UVWPQE2D63F274VL7633" id-sequence="349">Dierks et al., 1999</span>). Simply asking patients to remember or imagine sounds did not produce the type of activity in the auditory cortex seen during an auditory hallucination, indicating that the hallucination experience is different from simple memory or imagination.</p> <p id="DHLPVXSE2ELU70CHL225" id-sequence="350">A further symptom of schizophrenia involves disorganized patterns of speech. The patient jumps inexplicably from one topic to the next. People with schizophrenia appear to have difficulty inhibiting secondary meanings for some words (<span class="citation" id="WJLRQAR2CH0322B6B295" id-sequence="351">Titone, Levy, &amp; Holzman, 2000</span>). For example, the word <em>jam</em> can refer to either a fruit spread for toast or an impromptu musical session. Most people would use context (a conversation about food or music) to decide which meaning was appropriate. Patients with schizophrenia might not experience this filtering, leading their thoughts to jump from food to jazz and then on to other atypical connections.</p> <p id="ZSJP8HLKCHBBR8SLS709" id-sequence="352">This loosening of associations among ideas might occur because of the reduced latent inhibition in patients with schizophrenia, as discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>. According to this argument, latent inhibition typically results in fewer associations being made to familiar stimuli. If you have had a lot of experience connecting jam and food, you are unlikely to consider other uses of the word <em>jam</em>. The person with schizophrenia, however, would be less inhibited in making connections among ideas, leading to trains of thought that seem bizarre to the rest of us.</p> <p id="KKAP5FSW34QRBWZZ9917" id-sequence="353">Schizophrenia also features “grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior” (APA, 2013, p. 88). Some people may be unusually active, while others may barely move throughout an entire day. Unusual behaviors can occur, including grimaces and gestures. The maintenance of awkward or unusual body positions for hours at a time is called <em>catatonia</em>. People experiencing catatonia appear aware of their surroundings, but they don’t move. Most of us would find it difficult to sit for a few minutes, let alone hours, without shifting position.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="354"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="357"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="358" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="359" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="UUPVUQSCW66GU75AG257" id-sequence="360"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">14-5b</span> <span class="headingText">Causes of Schizophrenia</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="QCUJPXEW79V0X7P7X921_content" id-sequence="361"> <p id="CUHPD7GFK0YMXJRVJ165" id-sequence="362">Like many other types of psychological disorders, it is likely that schizophrenia has multiple sources of causality.

One reliable correlate of schizophrenia is the presence of enlarged ventricles (<span class="citation" id="RPBXK5C3KBWDY29PR711" id-sequence="376">Yotsutsuji et al., 2003</span>). As discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>, the ventricles are fluid-filled spaces in the brain that are not responsible for any particular behavior. The ventricles enlarge in response to any condition resulting in a loss of neural tissue in adjacent areas, so we can assume that schizophrenia is associated with neural degeneration.</p> <p id="MBZUMTCFPPA2ZJ1VH750" id-sequence="377">Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate differences in brain activity compared with healthy people. For example, patients with schizophrenia often show a lower level of frontal lobe activity than that of healthy controls, both at rest and during effortful cognitive tasks<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_560" data-page="560"></a> (<span class="citation" id="YMHRAYWFCSQYLMEND103" id-sequence="378">Berman, Torrey, Daniel, &amp; Weinberger, 1992</span>). The importance of the frontal lobes to higher cognitive processes and attention suggests that this difference would have significant influences on behavior, and lower levels of activity might account for the emotional disturbances and social withdrawal seen in these patients (<span class="citation" id="BGNDSFXD6WLD4QNQV188" id-sequence="379">Andreasen et al., 1992</span>). Pathways in the brain that manage olfaction, or the sense of smell, travel through the frontal lobe.

The person’s behavior, characterized by little need for sleep, rapid speech, difficulty concentrating, and rapidly shifting ideas, seems to be running at an abnormally high speed. Unlike many other disorders, however, mania increases productive, goal-directed behavior. However, because of the person’s tendency to meet the DSM-5 criterion for “excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences,” hospitalization is often necessary for the patient’s protection (APA, 2013, p. 124).

Mood disturbances can be associated with hormonal changes in women, including postpartum depression and mood changes accompanying menopause (Rapkin, Mikacich, Moatakef-Imani, &amp; Rasgon, 2002). However, it is also possible that women are more likely than men to admit feeling depressed to others and to seek help with depression. Men may mask or cover their depressed mood by engaging in activities such as drinking alcohol.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1769 rs_skip" id="JMDDAXUW8TN8CMJBN977" clrenderdata="[&quot;TTGMM4XL2BQNVMMSV198&quot;]" id-sequence="469"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_f11-t2.png" data-width="476" data-height="473" data-alt="A horizontal triple bar graph shows the prevalence of major depressive disorder per 100,000 people per year across different regions of the world in males and females.

Susan Nolen-Hoeksema describes rumination in depression as “repetitively focusing on the fact that one is depressed; on one’s symptoms of depression; and on the causes, meanings, and consequences of symptoms of depression” (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, p. 569). Rumination can arise from attempts to <span class="smallcaps">g</span>ain insight into one’s problems, but too much rumination interferes with problem solving (<span class="citation" id="DAHJARWE3DX6TGF25418" id-sequence="495">Watkins &amp; Brown, 2002</span>). When rumination is encouraged by asking study participants to focus on their mood, they find it difficult to solve several types of problems (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TBTK5MG62SUJ8HGEL894" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-section-id="MSPX4A92Q55AJ66FZ839" data-element-id="TBTK5MG62SUJ8HGEL894">Figure 14.12</a>). When the participants are distracted from this inward focus by thinking about neutral topics (such as “think about the Statue of Liberty”), their problem-solving abilities improve immediately. Typically, rumination is correlated with negative outcomes, including delaying recovery from MDD during treatment (<span class="citation" id="DYAQR8Z0X9MFBVQR9278" id-sequence="496">Siegle, Sagratti, &amp; Crawford, 1999</span>), predicting MDD following the death of a loved one (<span class="citation" id="SBUT9TXUMUHH013PL658" id-sequence="497">Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Girgus, 1994</span>) and increasing a person’s likelihood to abuse alcohol (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003). Responding to problems by either<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_566" data-page="566"></a> ruminating or distracting oneself might help explain some gender differences in depression rates.

Overall, people who make internal, stable, and global attributions (what happens to me is my fault, circumstances never change, and I’m always this way) are more prone to depression.

A number of genes have been implicated in depression, including genes affecting serotonin function (<span class="citation" id="LFFTEK7UBYGSFNUGB356" id-sequence="516">Wurtman, 2005</span>). A large body of research points to a role for serotonin in the regulation of mood. Serotonin’s role in brain systems responsible for mood, appetite, and sleep corresponds closely to the symptoms of MDD outlined in the <em>DSM-5</em>. Most effective medications for the treatment of depression boost the activity of serotonin at the synapse.</p> <p id="DWQW76PCXWRD1HEWE547" id-sequence="517">The anterior cingulate cortex plays an important role in regulating emotion through its connections with the amygdala.

According to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention (AFSP), we can make ourselves aware of risk factors and take actions that might save a life (AFSP, 2014). Among these risk factors are evidence of a psychological<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_570" data-page="570"></a> disorder (particularly depression), alcohol and other substance use, a history of suicide attempts, being male (males have a three to five times higher suicide completion rate than females), and impulsivity. More immediately, the occurrence of a traumatic event (job loss or ending of an important relationship) might increase a person’s risk.</p> <p id="BCLPYDSRDMYUXPSXP617" id-sequence="557">Approximately 75% of individuals who attempt suicide show prior evidence of their intent (AFSP, 2014). People might say things like “My family would be better off without me” or speak in ways that indicate they are saying good-bye. Purchasing a gun or putting one’s affairs in order (e.g., giving away prized possessions like a computer) is a sign of risk. Hopelessness, rage, or increased use of drugs and alcohol is also a common response to feeling suicidal (AFSP, 2014).</p> <p id="YTDY1MT08BLJP1BDQ974" id-sequence="558">If you suspect someone of being suicidal, experts advise you to take the situation seriously. Yes, it may be true that some people “cry wolf,” but with a life at stake, who wants to take that chance? Be a good listener, and reassure the person that depression can be treated, that he or she is not alone, and that you care. If possible, take your friend to a place where professional help is available, whether that is your campus health center or a local emergency room. Do not leave the person alone, and remove possible means of self-harm (drugs, weapons, etc.). If such steps are not possible, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800-273-TALK) or 911.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf176f rs_skip" id="RDEMT821P4PAKDW2G737" clrenderdata="[&quot;VXWBC9DJ7VK5HZ9C6507&quot;]" id-sequence="559"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_unf18-t2.jpg" data-width="262" data-height="389" data-alt="Understanding that the combination of depression, impulsivity, alcohol or substance use, a history of suicide attempts, and a recent breakup or other traumatic event may increase the risk of suicide can help us offer support to a person who exhibits these characteristics."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="LHDY4RKT23FDSL849920" id-sequence="560"><p>Understanding that the combination of depression, impulsivity, alcohol or substance use, a history of suicide attempts, and a recent breakup or other traumatic event may increase the risk of suicide can help us offer support to a person who exhibits these characteristics.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:262px;height:389px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_14_unf18-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Understanding that the combination of depression, impulsivity, alcohol or substance use, a history of suicide attempts, and a recent breakup or other traumatic event may increase the risk of suicide can help us offer support to a person who exhibits these characteristics." width="262" height="389" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Picture Partners/Alamy Stock Photo </div> </div></div></div> </div></div> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="GSEH2F882A8XFQH41961" id-sequence="561"> <h3 id="DQVR0HYDBR9R2RYDX631" id-sequence="562"><span class="headingText">Stress and MDD</span></h3> <p id="PFHBUZ73SG9JFN2Y6937" id-sequence="563">The experience of severe stress, whether arising from the death of a loved one, illness, or frustration of major life goals, frequently occurs immediately before the onset of a depressive episode (<span class="citation" id="TUMGL2MT1DYBFEVRK825" id-sequence="564">Brown &amp; Harris, 1989</span>; <span class="citation" id="STFV7M267VX54690S765" id-sequence="565"> Mazure, 1998</span>). The physical and cognitive responses to high levels of stress, such as difficulty sleeping or concentrating, are quite similar to the symptoms of MDD.

It is likely that underlying biological predispositions interact with cognitive patterns and life events to produce the disorder. For example, the serotonin transporter gene, which has been discussed previously in this book in the contexts of personality and responses to bullying, does little by itself to help predict a person’s risk for MDD. However, among people experiencing significant stress, those with one or two copies of the short version of the gene were more likely than those with two copies of the long version to develop MDD (<span class="citation" id="EHFQRVD5RFDVB4HYR959" id-sequence="572">Caspi et al., 2003</span>).</p> <p id="WMLYMRPCML38WZZW0314" id-sequence="573">A biological bridge is formed across the experience of stress, circadian rhythms, and the development of depression by the release of hormones (e.g., cortisol) when the stressor is perceived. Cortisol levels follow circadian patterns, with the greatest cortisol release in the early morning followed by a gradual drop throughout the day and evening. However, cortisol is also released at times of stress and helps prepare the body for fight or flight. Feedback loops involving the hippocampus usually prevent too great a release of cortisol. It is possible that in cases of MDD, this feedback loop is not working correctly, and cortisol levels remain high (<span class="citation" id="SLLBQX8AUCT34NU16489" id-sequence="574">Stokes, 1995</span>). The body simply cannot maintain high levels of arousal indefinitely, and MDD may result.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_571" data-page="571"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_summary

A stimulus (conditioned stimulus, or CS) becomes associated with a negative experience (unconditioned stimulus, or UCS) that results in fear (unconditioned response, or UCR), giving the CS the ability to elicit fear (conditioned response, or CR). We might be biologically prepared to form connections between certain stimuli and feelings of fear (<span class="citation" id="SLNBVQS3S1VPGGT7J804" id-sequence="747">Seligman, 1971</span>).

</span> is the fear of being scrutinized and criticized by others, particularly during public speaking and when meeting new people. Many of us are a little uneasy in these situations, but for people with social anxiety disorder, the fear and anxiety caused by these situations are out of proportion for the particular situation. In other words, the person with social anxiety disorder feels crippling anxiety while doing things that most people take in stride, like introducing yourself to others at a party. In most cases, social anxiety disorder begins during adolescence.

Symptoms typically last about 10 minutes. Feelings of intense fear or discomfort are accompanied by both physical and cognitive symptoms. Strong arousal of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the experience of a pounding heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, and dizziness or faintness. Not too surprisingly, people experiencing such symptoms may believe they are dying or going crazy. For some individuals, panic attacks may be brought on by identifiable stimuli, such as being<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_575" data-page="575"></a> swept along in a crowd. For others, the attacks seem to come out of nowhere. In either case, many people experiencing repeated attacks may begin to fear leaving their homes, a condition known as <em>agoraphobia</em>, which will be discussed in a later section.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="QPGFRDSE1RP0ASV76559" id-sequence="795"> <h3 id="BTDW1G713L555MPZ2542" id-sequence="796"><span class="headingText">Biological Explanations for Panic Disorder</span></h3> <p id="ZWJWC7KHP0SLQWGG2904" id-sequence="797">A clue to the biological origin of panic attacks is that they can be produced artificially in people with panic disorder, but not in people who do not have the disorder, by administering an injection of sodium lactate (<span class="citation" id="NUJZ8ZMBQAEPPQ1K8844" id-sequence="798">Papp et al., 1993</span>; <span class="citation" id="ZXPW58N3R84704LJ4959" id-sequence="799"> Pitts &amp; McClure, 1967</span>).

A person might interpret increased heart rate and rapid breathing as a heart attack instead of the result of having walked briskly from a parking lot. Concern about having a heart attack leads to further physiological arousal, which leads to more anxiety, and so on until a full state of panic is reached. Unfortunately for such theories, panic surprisingly does not increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which suggests that there is more to a panic attack than just responding to the stress of thinking that you are ill (<span class="citation" id="KURBMTC8JG0LQ4BH2122" id-sequence="805">Hollander et al., 1989</span>).</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="NSDZ6U574MF0L8PTP687" id-sequence="806"> <h3 id="BZBQQ5ZGEYSNNN92B973" id-sequence="807"><span class="headingText">Social Explanations for Panic Disorder</span></h3> <p id="RKECMWA9FN47BTDC1466" id-sequence="808">Social influences can be seen in the symptoms related by people with panic disorder.

</span> is diagnosed when a person has experienced excessive anxiety and worry for 6 months that is not correlated with particular objects or situations (APA, 2013). In other words, the person experiences a great deal of worry, but the worry is focused on life in general, not upcoming midterms or spiders. GAD is associated with physical complaints, including headache, stomachache, and muscle tension. GAD is often comorbid, or coexisting, with other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and depression (APA, 2013).</p> <div class="pageSection" id="XZZHLCM2ZUMVXKHD0217" id-sequence="849"> <h3 id="HDEF3ZDCWRNMN75DR606" id-sequence="850"><span class="headingText">Biological Explanations for GAD</span></h3> <p id="FGQP8LYE1Z82BRJAS736" id-sequence="851">Like all anxiety disorders, GAD shows evidence of genetic predisposition (<span class="citation" id="GWPRJ2Y79A2KTYKNR819" id-sequence="852">Kendler et al., 1995</span>; <span class="citation" id="ZRZYBKA64MPSHCCKG782" id-sequence="853"> Molina et al., 2011</span>).

For example, if you see a driver’s angry face in your rearview mirror, your amygdala alerts the prefrontal cortex about a potential threat or danger, and your prefrontal cortex uses memories of similar past experiences and reasoning to decide to pull over safely to the slower lane to let the angry driver go by.

</span> is the current term used to describe a condition formerly known as <em>shell shock</em> or <em>battle fatigue</em>. PTSD is unique among disorders listed in the <em>DSM-5</em> because it is the only one with a specified cause: To be diagnosed with PTSD, you must have experienced trauma (APA, 2013). Although combat, especially hand-to-hand combat, is still recognized as one of the most likely experiences leading to PTSD, we now understand that other types of trauma may produce the same results (Insel, 2007). PTSD may follow the experience of automobile accidents, assaults, abuse, and natural disasters.</p> <p id="WSDTADXKLJUFCSP78325" id-sequence="956">PTSD symptoms include hypervigilance, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, emotional numbing, and reexperiencing in the form of repetitive, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and dreams about the traumatic event (APA, 2013).The last thing that a person in this situation wants to do is to relive the traumatic event, so these symptoms are upsetting. Children with PTSD often reenact the traumatic event in their play (<span class="citation" id="RJCHCB97QBZE34LR0698" id-sequence="957">Cohen, Chazan, Lerner, &amp; Maimon, 2010</span>). In other words, they may play “terrorist attack,” “car crash,” or “tsunami,” possibly in an effort to reduce their fear. This reenactment play can have either positive or negative effects on the child. Children whose play included a reworking of the traumatic event (revenge or a happy ending) were less disturbed than children whose play was repetitive, without resolution.</p> <p id="PUQCJGGWRGVZMKP9J280" id-sequence="958">PTSD affects between 3% and 4% of the adult population in the United States every year (<span class="citation" id="MUTKLXXACV24F6CVP854" id-sequence="959">Kessler et al., 2007</span>). After large-scale traumatic events, health workers typically expect about 10% of the population to develop PTSD (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, &amp; Nelson, 1996). For example, more than 12% of lower Manhattan residents developed PTSD following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (<span class="citation" id="LCBJ4Y63EXV930U8W154" id-sequence="960">DiGrande et al., 2008</span>). Children are more vulnerable than adults, with 25% developing PTSD following automobile accidents in which they were injured, compared to 15% of their parents (de Vries, 1999). Between 8.5% and 14% of combat soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan experienced severe impairment because of symptoms of PTSD after returning home, and up to 31% experienced some impairment (<span class="citation" id="BZNGAGGRGK3T511X4660" id-sequence="961">Thomas et al., 2010</span>).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="962"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="965"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="966" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="967" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="BCGWEWVDSVD3NLU1J975" id-sequence="968"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">14-10a</span> <span class="headingText">Biological Explanations for PTSD</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="PJYE4VCHFU6D9S101587_content" id-sequence="969"> <p id="FEDEWA683U3ZA81XM398" id-sequence="970">Biological explanations for PTSD focus on the hippocampus, a structure that has been discussed previously in the context of the biology of memory formation.

This leaves us with two competing hypotheses: Are people with a naturally smaller hippocampus more vulnerable to PTSD? Or is there something about the experience of trauma that is toxic to the hippocampus? Both hypotheses seem reasonable. As we observed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapter 7</a>, stress increases the release of cortisol, which in turn might have toxic effects on the hippocampus (<span class="citation" id="UWSCENVK1PC5XRV4L231" id-sequence="973">Sapolsky, Krey, &amp; McEwen, 1985</span>). In Vietnam veterans with PTSD, decreases in hippocampal volume are greater as a function of the amount of time that has elapsed since a traumatic event, suggesting that hippocampal damage can continue steadily because of the disorder (<span class="citation" id="RMGQT0Z9NEK61DAH4412" id-sequence="974">Chao, Yaffe, Samuelson, &amp; Neylan, 2014</span>). Comparisons of twins have also identified PTSD-related damage to the anterior cingulate cortex (<span class="citation" id="JYQQEP3ZK8U4JDWPB533" id-sequence="975">Kasai et al., 2008</span>).</p> <p id="AEEF7KZNACRVSMXFL562" id-sequence="976">PTSD is correlated with lower levels of naturally occurring benzodiazepine activity in the frontal cortex (<span class="citation" id="DSKS9QTAEGM14Q4A8750" id-sequence="977">Geuze et al., 2008</span>) (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TVTXVJM82U415XEKZ810" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-section-id="PJYE4VCHFU6D9S101587" data-element-id="TVTXVJM82U415XEKZ810">Figure 14.20</a>). Extra benzodiazepines can be administered in the form of major tranquilizers, such as Valium, which produce relaxation and lack of anxiety. If naturally occurring benzodiazepine activity was low, anxiety would be the logical result. Lower levels of natural benzodiazepine activity might also explain the unfortunate tendency for people to self-medicate for PTSD with alcohol (<span class="citation" id="WABWNSNG619MMJ9PJ360" id-sequence="978">Jakupcak et al., 2010</span>).

Before the popularization of patients named Sybil and Eve in books and films, few cases of dissociative identity disorder had ever been described in the scientific literature. Following this media interest, thousands of cases were diagnosed, primarily in the United States and Canada. Responses to extreme stress frequently include detachment, numbness, or altered memory and cognition, but this is quite different from the development of additional identities. Well-meaning therapists can misinterpret these stress symptoms as dissociative identity disorder and, worse yet, suggest this possibility to their clients. People diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, like those with other dissociative disorders, score very high on tests of suggestibility that predict a person’s susceptibility to hypnosis, as well as in measures of being likely to fantasize (<span class="citation" id="YGUKFC51C03W6H8FU777" id-sequence="1025">Giesbrecht, Lynn, Lilienfeld, &amp; Merckelbach, 2010</span>).

The <em>DSM-5</em> notes that these patients spend excessive amounts of time thinking about the seriousness of their symptoms, which is accompanied by<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_582" data-page="582"></a> a high level of anxiety. To the patient, the somatic symptoms appear quite serious and often disabling. Among the different symptoms are vague pain complaints, gastrointestinal upset, sexual problems, amnesia, breathing problems, or unexplained sensory or motor problems. People with somatic symptoms usually visit physicians frequently, report high numbers of physical complaints, and are at risk of becoming dependent on pain medication. They can become preoccupied with their health and often insist on unnecessary medical tests and procedures.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1037"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1040"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1041" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1042" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="QSLXN6U8EGMHLTSUK764" id-sequence="1043"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">14-13</span> <span class="headingText">What Are Personality Disorders?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="PGQU1JMUNBXB6K38R502_content" id-sequence="1044"> <p id="TDGD1S2NXQYS8H47T033" id-sequence="1045">A <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf12eb" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf12eb"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf12eb" id="AVFVC2YDGQ6BJJMW2347" id-sequence="1046"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">personality disorder</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="UFHS8SUTHABU79J18792" id-sequence="1047">personality disorder</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A disorder characterized by impairments in identity, in personality traits, and in establishment of empathy or intimacy.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf12eb">

</span> is characterized by a “pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others” (APA, 2013, p. 659). Individuals with this disorder have little regard for normal social rules and conventions. Their behavior is frequently risky and irresponsible, and they form shallow, fleeting relationships with others.</p> <p id="YPMGUTD914FMABT22006" id-sequence="1061">ASPD is quite similar to the term <em>psychopath</em>, which has not been used by the <em>DSM</em> system since its third edition was published in 1980. Criteria for ASPD in <em>DSM-III</em> and <em>DSM-IV</em> focused on a person’s behaviors, especially criminal behaviors, whereas the term <em>psychopath</em> implies flaws in the person’s consistent traits or character (<span class="citation" id="GJUFEBD8PZ4DV1F86580" id-sequence="1062">Hare, 2006</span>). Between 0.2% and 3.3% of the population experiences ASPD in a given year (APA, 2013). <span class="citation" id="QGBRY0RDHXU10MDVF001" id-sequence="1063"> Hare (2006)</span> has estimated the number of psychopaths in the United States to be approximately 1%.</p> <p id="NGCYENUMFFG2RBM4Q200" id-sequence="1064">Most individuals with ASPD or psychopathy do not engage in outright criminal behavior, and not all criminals have ASPD or psychopathy. Noncriminal individuals with ASPD were easily recruited by placing a newspaper ad calling for “charming, aggressive, carefree people who are impulsively irresponsible but are good at handling people and at looking after number one” (<span class="citation" id="XYNTDCZ68RUVFYMCC507" id-sequence="1065">Widom, 1978</span>, p. 72).</p> <div class="pageSection" id="WKDTGJEF955L414FC421" id-sequence="1066"> <h3 id="CTTTD4CVTEZ2N366Q581" id-sequence="1067"><span class="headingText">Causes of ASPD</span></h3> <p id="XHGUJPYB94FBYGJWD048" id-sequence="1068">Research on individuals with antisocial parents suggests a genetic contribution to this disorder.

When children of biological parents who are not antisocial are adopted by antisocial parents, they are less likely than children with biological parents who are antisocial to engage in antisocial behavior (<span class="citation" id="QQZGXV09C82URWRR3309" id-sequence="1071">Mednick &amp; Kandel, 1988</span>).

One suggestion is that fearlessness characterizes both heroes and people with antisocial behavior (<span class="citation" id="BSHP6BS7GRJFVMFE6394" id-sequence="1074">Lykken, 1982</span>). Having heroic people in your population might offset the negative impact of having some antisocial people. To test his hypothesis about the similarities between these two groups, Lykken devised an Activity Preference Questionnaire, which asks respondents to choose between a frightening or embarrassing situation and one that is simply unpleasant.<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_583" data-page="583"></a> For example, would you prefer to wash a car or drive a car 95 miles per hour? People who either engage in antisocial behavior or who have behaved heroically typically choose the risky alternative (driving fast) over a chore (washing car), whereas cautious people typically choose the chore over the risky alternative.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1782 rs_skip" id="EJNWDZ2Y78DQ5D2NT197" clrenderdata="[&quot;TADEX0MNTPZHPC144974&quot;]" id-sequence="1075"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_unf32-t2.png" data-width="582" data-height="316" data-alt="Two brain scans show reduced activity in criminal psychopaths."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="PZEAZ4L86SP2SUCG9252" id-sequence="1076"><p>The areas marked in blue showed less activity in criminal psychopaths than in noncriminal control participants in a study during the processing of negative emotional words like <em>rape</em> or <em>torture</em>.

While undergoing brain imaging, people with ASPD, unlike the control participants in a study, showed little activation of parts of the brain that are usually active during emotional processing when listening to words such as <em>torture</em>, <em>rape</em>, or <em>cancer</em> (<span class="citation" id="RLKGSKDJSK17E2L34475" id-sequence="1079">Hare, 2006</span>; <span class="citation" id="VCTURSEMUHK2EJQXQ920" id-sequence="1080"> Kiehl et al., 2001</span>). Participants also were shown neutral scenes and rather gruesome images of murder scenes. Again, the people with ASPD showed different patterns of brain activation than did the typical control participants. In particular, the amygdalae of people with ASPD showed relatively little activity.

With slides in the background depicting convicted WorldCom chief executive officer Bernard Ebbers and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, Hare asked his audience why law enforcement personnel are screened for psychopathy, but not executives responsible for millions of dollars of people’s savings and retirement funds.</p> <p id="XPEZUG3LKTBVTEM1E014" id-sequence="1091">When we hear the term <em>psychopath</em>, most of us think of characters like Hannibal Lecter from <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. However, Hare and other psychologists suggest that psychopaths are more likely to be the people next door, your coworkers, and maybe even your friends and relatives. Not only are psychopaths relatively common (around 1% of the population), but their characteristics also might allow them to be disturbingly successful. When profiles of 39 top British executives were compared to those of criminals and psychiatric patients, the executives were found to be more charming, egotistical, manipulative, and lacking in empathy (<span class="citation" id="MJYK7Q4ZRK5JA1X2P208" id-sequence="1092">Board &amp; Fritzon, 2005</span>). Consequently, researchers began to refer to the executives as “successful” psychopaths, whereas the criminals and patients were “unsuccessful” psychopaths. Hare and his colleague, Paul Babiak, would agree. Using scales that they hope to market to corporations wishing to avoid hiring the next Fastow, these researchers have shown that corporate psychopaths score very high on items measuring the callous, selfless, and remorseless use of others (<span class="citation" id="FNUDU31AHYFT2BWV7813" id-sequence="1093">Babiak &amp; Hare, 2006</span>). Unlike criminal psychopaths, however, the corporate psychopaths did not show patterns of instability and social deviance.</p> <p id="JQAHAUGK3GWD2WZRW615" id-sequence="1094">Unfortunately, rapid and uncertain change in the business environment may provide fertile ground for corporate psychopaths to rise to the top. In a world of downsizing, an executive like Sunbeam’s “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap, who fired half the corporation’s workforce, might look like the right person for the job. But Dunlap also had been divorced by his first wife for “extreme cruelty,” thrown a chair at one of his executives, allegedly altered Sunbeam’s financial records to make his performance look better, and demanded additional severance pay when he was fired for cause.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1784 rs_skip" id="XPKQF9TVLNUB8TE7D405" clrenderdata="[&quot;QHJLNF1P5DHKRG6JP389&quot;]" id-sequence="1095"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_unf34-t2.jpg" data-width="288" data-height="300" data-alt="Bernie Madoff built one of the most successful businesses on Wall Street and served as the nonexecutive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market before being convicted of perpetrating one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history.

</span> is characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy (APA, 2013). Renewed interest in NPD has occurred in part due to questions about possible intersections between narcissism and social media use (<span class="citation" id="QZBHJBD81EHHSVJGF581" id-sequence="1132">McCain &amp; Campbell, 2016</span>). Other psychologists are tracking narcissistic traits as a function of age, with younger individuals showing more narcissism than older adults (<span class="citation" id="TBBHTF3NBYEGWVBUH492" id-sequence="1133">Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2009</span>).</p> <p id="LMJBF8763K10X1PFQ317" id-sequence="1134">Although the <em>DSM-5</em> has only one category for NPD, psychologists continue to debate the relationship between two apparent subtypes—the grandiose narcissist and the vulnerable narcissist (<span class="citation" id="FKQCY5FGR0V0U53U0912" id-sequence="1135">Miller et al., 2011</span>; <span class="citation" id="QDZFXCLM0MY75QTML073" id-sequence="1136"> Miller, Lynam, Hyatt, &amp; Campbell, 2017</span>). The grandiose narcissist tends to show inflated views of self-worth, aggressiveness, and dominance, while the vulnerable narcissist combines inflated views of self-worth with insecurity, defensiveness, and negative emotions. According to Miller et al. (2011, 2017), the <em>DSM</em> emphasizes the grandiose version, which might result in clinicians being less aware of the vulnerable version among their clients. One possible solution is to use trait models like the Big Five traits, described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>, to distinguish between the two patterns. For example, the grandiose narcissist is extroverted, while the vulnerable narcissist is shy and neurotic.</p> <p id="JEBYQCCC16N7CC4RX733" id-sequence="1137">We are not certain how narcissistic behavior develops. The personality disorder itself is not to be diagnosed officially until adulthood, but the roots of narcissism might be found in the development of self-esteem strategies in the child (<span class="citation" id="VUNGDX41XRFDZYAA9176" id-sequence="1138">Thomaes, Bushman, De Castro, &amp; Stegge, 2009</span>). As such, narcissism might be simply an extreme version of the impression management and search for esteem that are considered normal in children and teens.</p> <p id="LRAU1Y6CLC8NMWPC9920" id-sequence="1139">Narcissistic traits have been shown to be somewhat heritable, and they possibly have their beginnings in basic temperament (<span class="citation" id="EPBE5EBP2DNNJZDTY500" id-sequence="1140">Thomaes et al., 2009</span>). <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a> discussed <em>reactivity</em>, or a child’s tendency to either approach or avoid a stimulus. The pattern of behavior seen in the<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_587" data-page="587"></a> grandiose narcissist is consistent with approach, while the vulnerable narcissist seems to show both approach and avoidant tendencies. As discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>, temperament quickly interacts with environmental factors, particularly those in the surrounding social setting. Parents who overpraise their children might produce habituation to praise, leading a child to seek constantly higher levels of positive feedback. Cold parents with very high expectations for their children might also stimulate narcissistic behaviors as children attempt to protect themselves while craving positive feedback from others as compensation.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_experiencingpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="HBKDZ4QKCFMJEAPU8625" label="experiencingpsychology" id-sequence="1141"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Experiencing Psychology </span><h3 id="RUMF24PZETLPTBWB4972" id-sequence="1142">Assessing Narcissism</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="HBKDZ4QKCFMJEAPU8625_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1143"> <p id="DENF7J0HVTXF5KG21845" id-sequence="1144">As you have Read in this Chapter, narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, entitlement, and low empathy. While this doesn’t sound very attractive, people who score high in narcissistic traits are also likely to score high on measures of creativity, happiness, and self-esteem, while scoring low on measures of anxiety and depression (<span class="citation" id="QVDZTKH4TYJEG3RSZ334" id-sequence="1145">Konrath, Meier, &amp; Bushman, 2014</span>).</p> <p id="BTPSR57USB00F08NU411" id-sequence="1146">Measuring narcissism is difficult because of the possible dual nature of this trait. In addition to the grandiose behaviors, many individuals show a vulnerable, hypersensitive quality, which makes them shy and fragile in the face of criticism. As a result, the many self-report scales for measuring narcissism do not always agree well with one another. What we present here are two short scales of narcissism, the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (<span class="citation" id="QHRQBPV5HJPG8U079558" id-sequence="1147">Hendin &amp; Cheek, 1997</span>) and the Single-Item Narcissism Scale (<span class="citation" id="JLLV2JDLRADXZ05Q7239" id-sequence="1148">Konrath et al., 2014</span>). As you complete the scales, your results are more likely to be meaningful to you if you answer the items as honestly as possible (attempting to avoid social desirability effects). See if the two scales provide you with consistent results. Do you think these scales are valid?</p> <div class="pageSection" id="TGPHWV1ZT274XPFU1589" id-sequence="1149"> <h3 id="YNFPJBT77JU5DSB4P426" id-sequence="1150"><span

Soldiers, most of whom are about the same ages as those of you reading this textbook, are permanently changed by their experiences in ways that are often difficult for those of us who have not shared those experiences to understand. They have faced the fear of death and the realities of injury, held dying friends in their arms, and felt guilty that their lives were spared.</p> <p id="YVGQ9B0G22P3Z8GK8881" id-sequence="1291">Some cope with these challenges better than others. As stated earlier in this chapter, between 8.5% and 14% of U.S. veterans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan experience severe PTSD, and up to 31% experience some impairment (<span class="citation" id="LAHMY8XKSLWRY2V5Y443" id-sequence="1292">Thomas et al., 2010</span>). Veterans usually come home to their loved ones and families, who are also affected by the soldiers’ combat experiences in what has been called <em>secondary traumatization</em> (<span class="citation" id="FWDN8LZRZ6EA9PAWL843" id-sequence="1293">Galovski &amp; Lyons, 2004</span>). Although not directly threatened, the soldiers’ families have had challenges of their own as they cope with their helpless fear of loss. Understanding that bad news comes to the front door in the person of a military chaplain makes each FedEx delivery or visit by a neighbor a heart-pounding experience. The spouses who have learned over the course of a year to run households independently and balance the checkbook might not want to share some of these responsibilities with their returning partners.</p> <p id="SJPJSM93BF4RXG8VB800" id-sequence="1294">Among the biggest challenges for veterans with PTSD and their families are the results of having symptoms of hyperarousal, emotional numbing, and stimulus avoidance (<span class="citation" id="MPVN911BBHTWXBZ77560" id-sequence="1295">Monson, Taft, &amp; Fredman, 2009</span>). Although veterans without PTSD have the same rates of intimate aggression as the general population, the risk of intimate aggression is much higher in those with PTSD, and the severity of symptoms predicts the likelihood of aggression. Because of the emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms of PTSD, returning veterans do not engage in much self-disclosure, or discussion of their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

In this chapter, we reflect on the role of psychological disorder in producing this behavior. Our general definition of abnormal behavior includes “harm to others,” and cyberbullying certainly fits that criterion.</p> <p id="XSXTP626GRFK1A9Z5872" id-sequence="1306">Research on traditional, face-to-face bullying has implicated traits known as the Dark Triad of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (<span class="citation" id="JUMP7VNT0WR8C499L091" id-sequence="1307">Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002</span>). Narcissism and psychopathy already have been described in detail in this chapter; <em>Machiavellianism</em> refers to coldness, dishonesty, and calculated manipulation to achieve a person’s goals. More recently, scientists have argued for adding a fourth trait, sadism, to the Dark Triad (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak, &amp; Vedder, 2017). <em>Sadism</em> refers to the tendency to take pleasure in the suffering of others, and it is uniquely correlated with many types of antisocial behavior. This trait can be assessed using the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies Scale (VAST; <span class="citation" id="YUKJJDFC1XXNED4FW479" id-sequence="1308"> Paulhus, Jones, Boyle, Saklofske, &amp; Matthews, 2015</span>).</p> <p id="GZRPPGZSK9N11NKKK127" id-sequence="1309">In a large sample of older teens and young adults, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism were related to traditional bullying, but only sadism was related to cyberbullying (van Geel et al., 2017). This suggests that looking for elements of psychopathology associated with traditional bullying to predict likely cyberbullies might not be fruitful. Assessing sadism, however, should not only identify individuals prone to cyberbullying, but to antisocial behaviors in general.</p> </div></div> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1788 rs_skip" id="CAMMW3ZY564LZUBYD958" clrenderdata="[&quot;NTUXMZFCCKPCANTAZ625&quot;]" id-sequence="1310"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_14_unf37-t2.png" data-width="579" data-height="350" data-alt="A photo grid shows the different ranges in facial expressions for a boy and girl in three different behaviors.

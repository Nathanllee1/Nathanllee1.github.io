We can zoom in to look at these neural circuits, like these sympathetic axons (in blue in the large image on the previous page) forming connections with the gut. We have all had the feeling of butterflies in our stomach when we are excited, and these types of neural pathways are responsible for such feelings.</p> <p id="BEHEZB97DSVKPE581329" id-sequence="29">Zooming out, we can examine emotion and motivation in the larger context of the individual using the example of elite athletes at the Olympic Games. The 2016 Rio Games featured 11,544 athletes from 205 countries, a tiny fraction of the millions of people who compete in athletics worldwide. To stand out among these elites takes extreme motivation, not to mention talent and hard work. Many athletes competing at this level have focused on their sport to the exclusion of most other activities since they were in elementary school, yet of the more than 11,000 participants, only 972 (or 8%) went home with a medal.</p> <p id="VSJCMLCXRF1UC1MNZ234" id-sequence="30">Given the odds of obtaining a medal, you would think that any athlete winning one would be ecstatic, but that is not always the case. As you can see in the photograph of Olympic swimmers on the medal stand, the athletes are showing a range of emotions. Look for a moment at the way the three athletes are holding their flower bouquets. The gold and bronze medalists are holding their bouquets straight up, but the silver medalist is close to dropping his bouquet. His entire demeanor says dejection and disappointment.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1560 rs_skip" id="FREE5X9NWW4204KRH020" clrenderdata="[&quot;EAKHWDQBVM3Q1HGEU614&quot;]" id-sequence="31"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf01-t2.jpg" data-width="276" data-height="238" data-alt="The Feeling Mind"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:276px;height:238px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf01-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="The Feeling Mind" width="276" height="238" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Michael Steele/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <p id="VPGEPC45E4JULX1BX648" id-sequence="32">Why would a silver medalist be disappointed with such an exceptional achievement?

</span> is defined as a process that arouses, maintains, and guides behavior toward a goal. For example, we are motivated to seek a drink of water in response to thirst. The process of motivation is accompanied by distinct emotional states. Thirst is generally quite distressing, and taking a drink of water can produce positive emotions like relief and happiness.</p> <p id="LBKCBGWU806RF7TB7681" id-sequence="65">Emotion and motivation share the ability to arouse an organism and stimulate behavior, but motivation does so more directly and precisely than emotions do. People who feel motivated by thirst are likely to do one thing: seek something to drink. In contrast, experiencing the emotion of sadness stimulates behavior, but that behavior can take many forms. Some people respond to sadness by crying in a room by themselves, while others seek the company of friends.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="66"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="69"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="70" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="71" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="PGTNC5XAMM6D1UJ5R846" id-sequence="72"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">7-2</span> <span class="headingText">Why Are We Emotional?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="AHWH2MKEVGRZ9E8QZ825_content" id-sequence="73"> <p id="ADCB23KVV2339NNS0946" id-sequence="74">Whether we’re experiencing happiness or sadness, anger or disgust, an emotion combines a physical sensation, such as a rapid heartbeat, and a conscious, subjective feeling, like joy or sadness.

At the core of the James-Lange theory is the idea that this type of emotion is the result of a sequence of events. Once the individual perceives a stimulus, such as a grizzly bear, that person experiences a physiological response. This physiological response is subsequently interpreted by the individual, giving rise to a conscious awareness of a subjective feeling. The James-Lange theory assumes that physical states related to each type of feeling (sadness and happiness, for instance) are distinct from one another. The theory also assumes that we are capable of correctly labeling these distinct physical states as separate feelings. As James wrote, “We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble” (1890, p. 1006).</p> <p id="HAFSG4FM2BEFC9MGX463" id-sequence="94">James’s statement may seem counterintuitive to you. Shouldn’t a good cry make us feel less sad, not more? Many people also believe that holding anger inside instead of expressing it somehow makes feelings of anger build up and become worse.

        <span class="pointer"></span>
    </span>
</span>. In catharsis, emotions are viewed as filling an emotional reservoir. When the reservoir fills up, the emotion will spill over in an uncontrolled manner. For example, we talk about a “buildup of hostility or anger” that somehow overflows, producing a more extreme response than is warranted by the situation. Catharsis theorists recommend that we avoid this buildup by regularly expressing our emotions. In other words, it might be better to express some anger regularly than to repress your anger and “explode.”</p> <p id="YJQCSWHQGKXA6K67Q663" id-sequence="97">Catharsis and the implications of the James-Lange theory are contradictory. One suggests that expressing an emotion reduces that feeling, while the other argues that expressing an emotion leads to the subjective feeling. Which is correct? If we are feeling sad, does having a good cry make us feel better or more aware of our sadness?</p> <p id="CTKMMY0KGXMZHCWDQ778" id-sequence="98">One clue to our dilemma comes from an experiment in which participants were directed to make specific movements of the face (Levenson, Ekman, &amp; Friesen, 1990). For example, they might be instructed to raise their eyebrows and form their mouth into the shape of an O. They were not informed that they were to make any particular facial expression, nor were they allowed to view their face in a mirror. They did, however, report “feeling” the emotion they had portrayed; you might have experienced a feeling of surprise if you followed the same directions. This result is consistent with the notion that expressing an emotion leads to the subjective feeling, rather than reducing it in ways predicted by catharsis. This experiment also supports the James-Lange approach by suggesting that feedback from the body helps us consciously determine the state of our emotions.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1566 rs_skip" id="KERM37QX1M8KR5PMN661" clrenderdata="[&quot;CLLZ3ZF0ZYV84S4DZ972&quot;]" id-sequence="99"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf05-t3.jpg" data-width="934" data-height="305"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf05-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="192" data-alt="Consistent with the James-Lange theory of emotion, the physical expression of an emotion might lead to subjective feelings.

A contemporary rugby team, the<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_234" data-page="234"></a> New Zealand All Blacks, uses the traditional <em>haka</em> of the players’ homeland to prepare for games.

By appearing to be happy, we might begin to feel happier. Another practical outcome of this approach is the impact of modeling facial expression on empathy. The early back-and-forth imitations of facial expressions by adults and infants may contribute to the capacity to read others’ emotions. When students are asked to determine the emotions expressed in the photos on page 245 during a classroom presentation, it is not uncommon to see some individuals spontaneously copy the facial expression in question to identify it correctly.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1567 rs_skip" id="EPWWYYMUHJ0Y3E6P9112" clrenderdata="[&quot;WASWYJML2698DCERB708&quot;]" id-sequence="103"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf06-t2.jpg" data-width="376" data-height="603" data-alt="John Stibbard, son of the owner of the Capilano Suspension Bridge, poses on the bridge with the Olympic torch after completing his leg of the torch run in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="KAWPRU0MPCTHJE1H7451" id-sequence="104"><p>John Stibbard, son of the owner of the Capilano Suspension Bridge, poses on the bridge with the Olympic torch after completing his leg of the torch run in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:376px;height:603px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf06-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="John Stibbard, son of the owner of the Capilano Suspension Bridge, poses on the bridge with the Olympic torch after completing his leg of the torch run in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada." width="376" height="603" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">AP Images/Matt Dunham </div> </div></div></div> <p id="QRZW9WJY14MQ8AL7K669" id-sequence="105">We might not be as good at reading our physical states as the James-Lange theory requires us to be. One experiment that challenged our ability to distinguish correctly among the physical states of different emotions was carried out in Capilano Canyon, located in British Columbia (<span class="citation" id="LGAUAKCDLFPX15P6X856" id-sequence="106">Dutton &amp; Aron, 1974</span>). Capilano Canyon may be crossed at one of two locations. The first crossing involves a 450-foot-long bridge with low handrails, suspended about 230 feet above rocks and rapids. Farther upstream, the canyon may be crossed on a solid wooden bridge that is less frightening. In the study, an attractive female experimenter approached single men crossing one of the two bridges. After completing a short interview, the experimenter gave each man her telephone number, in case he had further questions about the experiment. Not only did the men on the frightening bridge include more sexual content in their interviews, but they were about four times as likely to telephone the female researcher later.</p> <p id="ENVGQ77PRBV9BY2UZ284" id-sequence="107">Although the study is flawed by a failure to randomly assign men to bridges (bolder men might be both more likely to choose the scary bridge and to telephone a stranger), it stimulated further thinking about the James-Lange theory. The results of this study suggest that its participants were not very good at discriminating the physical sensations associated with fear and sexual arousal. We can assume that the attractiveness of the female would be constant, suggesting that the setting in which she was seen largely accounted for the differences in sexual content in interviews and the likelihood of seeking further contact with her. One might speculate that similar mistakes underlie the popularity of horror films and amusement parks with impossibly high roller coasters as dating activities. Scare your date to death, and he or she may interpret feelings of fear as love. These results suggest that in some circumstances, we might not be as good at interpreting our physical sensations as predicted by the James-Lange theory.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="GNQSPUTKVLPURXE9W163" id-sequence="108"> <h3 id="ZPNX0QXTJ9D1MZEN1274" id-sequence="109"><span class="headingText">The Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion</span></h3> <p id="VFJAPKJYHKKCTDYQ5310" id-sequence="110">Walter Cannon disagreed with the James-Lange theory and proposed his own theory, which was later modified by Philip Bard, resulting in the <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1059" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1059"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1059" id="PVVZVSX0YTYXXT56U586" id-sequence="111"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Cannon-Bard theory</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="CTUDX3VV1J3CQ1JJT521" id-sequence="112">Cannon-Bard theory</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A theory of emotion featuring the simultaneous and independent occurrence of physical sensations and subjective feelings during an emotional experience.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1059">

The James-Lange theory proposes a sequence of events, from physical sensations to subjective feeling, but the Cannon-Bard theory proposes that both factors occur simultaneously and independently.</p> <p id="RMTP6C75A1PYXAL8U742" id-sequence="115">How are these theories different? Let’s assume that you are innocently reading your textbook in your room when a bear walks in the door. According to the James-Lange theory, the sight of the bear would immediately set off physical sensations that you would then cognitively interpret as fear. According to the Cannon-Bard theory, the sight of the bear would immediately and simultaneously trigger a subjective feeling of fear (“whoa, there’s a bear in my room”) and physical sensations (probably the autonomic nervous system’s fight-or-flight response in this example).

</span> differs from the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard approaches. For Schachter and Singer, the sight of the bear would initiate a general state of arousal. To identify the source of your arousal, you would assess your situation, attribute your arousal to the presence of a bear in your room, and identify your feelings as fear (with considerable accuracy, we would assume).</p> <p id="BLNMLH5717MLKXU9U555" id-sequence="123">Schachter and Singer (1962) directly tested this approach by injecting volunteers with epinephrine (adrenalin), which causes a high level of arousal. The participants had been told<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_236" data-page="236"></a> that they were getting an injection of a vitamin and that their vision would be tested as soon as another volunteer arrived to participate in the experiment. The second volunteer was actually an actor employed by the researchers. In half of the trials, the actor behaved in a happy, silly manner; in the other half, he acted angry and stomped out of the room. The results supported a role for cognitive appraisal of the environment in the identification of emotion. Participants who were exposed to the happy actor rated themselves as feeling happy, while participants exposed to the angry actor felt more negative. Importantly, when the participants were accurately informed that they were getting a drug that produced arousal instead of a vitamin, the behavior of the actor did not influence their assessment of the situation. Instead, they attributed their feelings to the drug.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_connectingtoresearch narrative  rs_skip" id="BZCKE2J4L63U4V0UM844" label="connectingtoresearch" id-sequence="124"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Connecting to Research </span><h3 id="CUFJMPRD6DGK4A58P162" id-sequence="125">Botox and the Ability to Read the Emotions of Others</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="BZCKE2J4L63U4V0UM844_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="126"> <p id="QFWUXT1BUCUEVS1HT786" id-sequence="127">Botox, a deactivated form of the same toxin that causes botulism poisoning from spoiled food, helps people with migraine headaches and neurological disorders of movement, but it is also used for cosmetic purposes.

The participants in the first experiment who used Botox had less facial mobility than the participants who used the dermal filler. The lack of facial mobility caused by Botox interfered with the participants’ ability to accurately assess another person’s facial expression of emotion. In the second experiment, making the muscles work harder to imitate a facial expression by applying a restrictive gel actually improved the participants’ ability to identify the facial expressions of others. These results are quite consistent with the James-Lange theory’s emphasis on feedback from the body as important to the subjective identification of emotion, not just in ourselves but also in other people. These results suggest that an important side effect of Botox might be a reduction in social competence and empathy because of an inability to read the emotions of other people correctly.</p> </div> </div></div> <p id="VTAT88JJMWS5H6HYP941" id-sequence="148">A later attempt to replicate Schachter and Singer’s study did not succeed (<span class="citation" id="EQTJM01J2W9E669L5550" id-sequence="149">Marshall &amp; Zimbardo, 1979</span>).

Additional support is provided by research that demonstrates that arousal produced by one emotion can transfer to and intensify a second emotion.

</span> begins with a recognition that physical responses to a stimulus can range from quite specific to quite general. For example, the physical sensations associated with disgust can be more precise than the physical sensations associated with pride.</p> <p id="ZKXVCZ2MS0FBJWN1U302" id-sequence="158">The initial degree of specificity of the physical response leads to different cognitive processing. A highly specific physical response leads to unambiguous recognition of a subjective feeling. This is the situation that appeared most interesting to James. A bear walks in, you react physically, and you know you’re scared. At the other extreme, instead of specific physical responses, a situation might produce general arousal, which requires significant cognitive processing and evaluation. For example, a valedictorian giving a graduation speech might not understand her arousal until she sees her parents and other members of the audience clapping and realizes the emotion she is feeling is pride. This scenario is closest to that proposed by Schachter and Singer (1962).</p> <p id="VWFJ8T5K9Y957228Y623" id-sequence="159">SAME provides middle ground between the James-Lange and the Schachter and Singer theories. If a physical response is only partially specific, an ambiguous message is sent forward that is clarified by the presence of additional cues or information (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="NUAWZKNTN11AFGZQ7637" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-section-id="EVLCTT96W39MA4RXA447" data-element-id="NUAWZKNTN11AFGZQ7637">Figure 7.4</a>). The model correctly predicts that emotional responses range from immediate to delayed based on the amount of cognitive processing that is required. Emotions that are associated with a precise set of physical responses, such as fear, occur quickly, but emotions that are associated with more general arousal, such as pride, occur relatively slowly.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf156a rs_skip" id="XJFP779C8GLAQZVTC010" clrenderdata="[&quot;DSBFPBA5X3AN67RV4287&quot;]" id-sequence="160"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf08-t3.jpg" data-width="703" data-height="256"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf08-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="213" data-alt="According to appraisal theory, a person who values wealth and a person who values family might experience different emotions in response to the same event."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="LNJQFY7A06069F79V302" id-sequence="161"><p>According to appraisal theory, a person who values wealth and a person who values family might experience different emotions in response to the same event.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:595px;height:213px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf08-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="According to appraisal theory, a person who values wealth and a person who values family might experience different emotions in response to the same event." width="595" height="213" style="cursor: pointer;" class="rs_skip">			<div class="enlarge" style="left:585px">

Appraisal theory further assumes that interpretation is a continuous process rather than a single decision about a stimulus (<span class="citation" id="YNHGLZ6BQJTPH0LFR127" id-sequence="172">Moors et al., 2013</span>). For example, attention may be aroused by some change in the environment. A recognizable emotion has not yet occurred, and if the appraisal of the stimulus determines it to be of no significance, arousal returns to baseline. However, if the stimulus is found to have positive or negative value to the individual making the appraisal (a source of food or a predator, for instance), feelings and physiological responses change yet again.</p> <p id="RVZHJGKFWDRHNQ1VY050" id-sequence="173">An emphasis on appraisal as a starting point for emotion may help us account for the vast range of emotional reactions that individuals might have to the same event (<span class="citation" id="TMNTY88BRRMS0DYHZ598" id-sequence="174">Moors et al., 2013</span>). One person may view material wealth as essential to happiness, whereas another may view successful relationships with others as a primary goal. These different cognitive patterns should produce different emotional responses to the same event. A letter to an advice columnist described a situation in which a man’s wife had wrecked his expensive antique automobile in a serious accident (Dear Abby, January 14, 2006). Our first person, who values money, is likely to respond with dismay at the loss of the expensive car. Our second person, who values relationships, is likely to be happy that his beloved wife survived the accident in one piece.</p> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="175"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="178"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="179" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="180" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="SEDAJSV7FU6N0LG83502" id-sequence="181"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">7-3</span> <span class="headingText">The Evolution of Emotion</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="BSXKYN60JNPRMHMY3340_content" id-sequence="182"> <p id="PWYRGPCXAH5XDZ616877" id-sequence="183">Emotional behavior is not unique to humans.

Evidence for a coordinated development of language and emotional communication remains in our contemporary brain, which uses the same pathways for language and for the perception and appreciation of music (Schön et al., 2010). Without the capacity to feel, we would find it difficult to appreciate a Picasso or the moving strains of “Yesterday”<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_240" data-page="240"></a> by the Beatles. We wouldn’t enjoy a good cry at the end of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> or be glued to the edge of our seats while watching <em>Mother!</em> The universal nature of human responses to many poems, pieces of music, and other artistic accomplishments points to shared underlying mechanisms, shaped through our evolutionary past. Shared enjoyment of the arts contributes greatly to social bonding in human societies. When we dance together, sing together, or watch plays and other visual displays of art, shared emotional responses contribute to feelings of community and closeness.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf156f rs_skip" id="PMTP7KXRST8DTPSQ9083" clrenderdata="[&quot;PBXYXBTHZXNQUD9D8204&quot;]" id-sequence="200"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf09-t2.jpg" data-width="385" data-height="248" data-alt="A photo shows an infant crying in the parent’s hands."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="QUEPWEG3PAG1TWU5R838" id-sequence="201"><p>Long before infants learn to speak, they can communicate with adults by using facial expressions.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:385px;height:248px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf09-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows an infant crying in the parent’s hands." width="385" height="248" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Firma V/ <a target="_blank" id="VFML1032WHXRBPCBV976" name="VFML1032WHXRBPCBV976" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="202">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="CSXLEZ8QY5UH9BJZ8601" id-sequence="203">We can identify further advantages of emotion by studying people whose emotional lives have been affected by brain damage.

The amygdala initiates responses through its tight connections with the hypothalamus, which in turn affects autonomic, hormonal, and behavioral processes. For example, when the amygdala perceives danger from environmental stimuli, it initiates a hormonal cascade involving the pituitary gland and the adrenal glands that produces an increased release of neurochemicals in the brain, leading to an increase in overall arousal. We will discuss this process in greater detail in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-element-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075">Chapter 16</a>.</p> <p id="NURU5PFZ0R0VNSAG8948" id-sequence="239">One of the first clues to the importance of the amygdala to emotion resulted from an experiment conducted in 1939 in which researchers removed both temporal lobes, which include the amygdalae, from rhesus monkeys (Klüver &amp; Bucy, 1939). After recovery, the normally hard-to-handle adult rhesus monkeys became tamer, and their emotions were less intense. They allowed themselves to be picked up and stroked, and they appeared to be relatively oblivious to stimuli that normally elicit intense fear, such as snakes. They made fewer fear-related grimaces and vocalizations.</p> <p id="RLCG2WTAJSZQBS7HG367" id-sequence="240">We now understand that whenever the amygdala is damaged, animals respond inappropriately to danger.

These muscles receive input from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, which control voluntary movement, as well as from subcortical areas, including the basal ganglia. The cortical input allows us to voluntarily “smile” for the camera. The subcortical input is responsible for more spontaneous expressions of emotion, such as laughing at a funny joke. It is possible to lose one type of input without affecting the other. The young man shown in the photo above has a tumor that affects his right motor cortex. When asked to smile voluntarily, his smile appears quite crooked because of the importance of the cortex in voluntary expression. When he smiles spontaneously to a joke, his smile appears more natural because his subcortical areas can still react normally. People with Parkinson’s disease, which damages the subcortical emotional pathways, show the opposite pattern. They may be unable to smile spontaneously in response to a joke, but they can smile voluntarily when asked to do so.</p> <p id="YKVUWT8ZDG4U8J7K2177" id-sequence="294">Do we learn how to express emotions, or are these behaviors built in?

We noted that Western cultures are more expressive than Eastern cultures, perhaps due to the contrast between individualism and collectivism. However, another factor that might explain variations in display rules is a culture’s history of immigration. In countries such as the United States, which has a long history of people immigrating from many different places, emotional expressivity appears to be higher than in countries with less immigration from fewer sources (<span class="citation" id="APFR5R4MR9JT6851Q854" id-sequence="444">Rychlowska et al., 2015</span>).

While aroused, people betray their lying in predictable ways (<span class="citation" id="YYERLN23H7GHMSLNN459" id-sequence="471">Ekman, 1996</span>). Inappropriate smiling and nervous laughter might reflect the person’s high arousal. A deceptive person stiffens the upper body, nods the head less frequently, and uses fewer hand gestures<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_250" data-page="250"></a> than normal. In contrast to the reduced mobility of the upper body, the feet swing. An unwillingness to make eye contact might indicate dishonesty. However, in many cultures, making eye contact is considered impolite, and failure to make eye contact should be interpreted cautiously.</p> <p id="HUXS6LLTTW831XJKE406" id-sequence="472">Liars experience more cognitive demand than truthful people as they must multitask while assembling their deception (<span class="citation" id="SDCDCS9Z7Q85RLUE8676" id-sequence="473">Vrij, 2015</span>). The liar may stumble verbally, adding “um” and “uh” while seeking to construct a plausible lie. Liars must manage how credible they appear to others. They may be distracted by their goals for lying, such as preventing embarrassment, avoiding criminal charges, or making money. They must actively suppress the truth to avoid slips. If the interviewer can add to the liar’s cognitive load by requesting continued eye contact and asking unanticipated questions, the liar is more likely to slip.</p> <p id="YHXZQ41USY0UM75S5592" id-sequence="474">An excellent signal that someone is lying is the use of “scripted” stories, which are lacking in detail. People telling the truth add 20 to 30% more detail to a story compared to liars (Colwell, Hiscock-Anisman, Memon, Taylor, &amp; Prewett, 2007). Another reliable way to identify lying is to ask people to tell their story backward in time (<span class="citation" id="JGQJR2823CG6331DB379" id-sequence="475">Fisher &amp; Geiselman, 2010</span>). A person telling the truth can simply move from one event to the next, but constructing a false story backward quickly overwhelms a person’s memory for details.</p> </div></div> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_251" data-page="251"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_summary narrative  rs_skip" id="QVXQPTVBGCZ9BVCQG550" label="summary" id-sequence="476"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Summary <span class="ordinal">7.1</span></span><h3 id="WHAHAKV993UWE3UAL556" id-sequence="477">Theories of Emotion</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="QVXQPTVBGCZ9BVCQG550_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="478"> <div class="table rs_skip" id="NRQBLUNVW7M2W0JQE252" id-sequence="479"> <div class="maintable narrowtable longtable" style="height: 711px;"><table data-width="540" class="frameall" style="width: 720px;"> <colgroup><col width="253"><col width="467"></colgroup> <thead> <tr id="KUPCTXLW20NX9KC0U896" id-sequence="480"> <th id="UGHTWGHVN925QVHX3905" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="481"><p id="EVZRFZNPH09WAVCM7241" id-sequence="482">Name of theory</p></th> <th id="MFJB9D7LN2NVRXR2K803" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore sidescore" id-sequence="483"><p id="SWRYSM58QNFLTSDNF328" id-sequence="484">Major features</p></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody id="FLQPUQ8Z6Y6GBCS6U396" id-sequence="485"> <tr class="odd" id="QJCYMH487VSZAEBJD032" id-sequence="486"> <td id="EADQ0HLT149CDZ9UH539" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="487"><p id="BHKBVU89H6807ZKQ4585" id-sequence="488"><strong><em>James-Lange theory</em></strong></p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf157e rs_skip" id="CECWBSY3NMQAGXRNL005" clrenderdata="[&quot;SWRE699XV589K16EC609&quot;]" id-sequence="489"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf17-t2.png" data-width="46" data-height="104" data-alt="An illustration depicts the James-Lange theory.

In some cases, extrinsic rewards can have negative effects on intrinsic motivation. For example, if a child who enjoys reading suddenly gets paid for each book completed, the child’s enjoyment of reading might decrease because the motivation shifts from intrinsic, the love of reading, to extrinsic, the love of reward money (<span class="citation" id="GALJ5RRETTRFQFZWV327" id-sequence="548">DeCharms, 1968</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1583 rs_skip" id="QLSZLTX6YZXWHBUWM585" clrenderdata="[&quot;XZLPY4VVGMJ0809MR656&quot;]" id-sequence="549"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf23-t2.jpg" data-width="219" data-height="309" data-alt="Economist Roland Fryer Asks whether Incentives Work."></div><div class="nb_media image"><div class="mediaTitle" id="UXAR6SY647NGJM4NH052" id-sequence="550"><span class="mediaFigureLabel"><span class="mediaLabelText">Figure </span><span class="mediaFigureNumber">7.14</span></span><span class="mediaAssetTitle">Economist Roland Fryer Asks whether Incentives Work.</span></div><div class="mediaDescription" id="WNXG7WHAKWDRKWAMT922" id-sequence="551"><p>Harvard University economist Roland Fryer overcame a tough childhood in Daytona, Florida, to become the youngest tenured African American professor in the history of the university. Drawing on his personal experiences, Fryer experimented with different incentives for a variety of school-related behaviors. His results suggest that the relationships among intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, and behavior can be quite complex. Although previous research has shown that extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation, it is important to remember that this result occurs only when behavior is intrinsically motivated in the first place. If children do not intrinsically enjoy reading, Fryer suggests paying them to read might work. Unfortunately, Fryer has been the target of death threats for suggesting this simple solution to illiteracy.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:219px;height:309px;"><img

The traditional diet of the Inuit people living in Arctic regions contains little plant material, whereas vegans adhere to a diet that contains no animal material.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1584 rs_skip" id="ZTJRZDXEP67G4UH4X024" clrenderdata="[&quot;RUGQEX5026LYYS8XE877&quot;]" id-sequence="646"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf22-t2.jpg" data-width="417" data-height="234" data-alt="A photo shows a plate of salad made of sliced greens, carrots, turnips, and tomatoes."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="BPDY9TQN6787MSRW1307" id-sequence="647"><p>Humans consume a range of diets, from the nearly all-meat diet of the traditional Inuit cultures to the vegan diet.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:417px;height:234px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf22-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows a plate of salad made of sliced greens, carrots, turnips, and tomatoes." width="417" height="234" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">dbimages/Alamy Stock Photo; <a target="_blank" id="GBWPS1WG3RRGLDK3F082" name="GBWPS1WG3RRGLDK3F082" class="external" href="http://iStock.com" id-sequence="648">iStock.com</a>/Elenathewise </div> </div></div></div> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_253" data-page="253"></a> <div class="pageSection" id="NLXENNY4LT1DH7FPY077" id-sequence="649"> <h3 id="BXSGM97RCHKAVUZFE337" id-sequence="650"><span class="headingText">The Sensation of Hunger</span></h3> <p id="QZKU78WSRX6ECXJ6B070" id-sequence="651">We respond to combinations of external and internal cues that make us feel hungry. External cues for hunger include time of day, the sights and smells of favorite foods, admonitions that we should “clean our plates,” or the social settings in which food is presented. These external cues may encourage us to eat when our bodies do not need nutrients or to eat more food than we require.

</span>. Glucose concentrations in the blood are highest just following a meal. As glucose levels drop over time, a person begins to feel hungry again. Glucose levels are intimately connected with levels of the hormone insulin. Insulin, released by the pancreas, moves circulating glucose from the blood into cells awaiting nutrients. Typically, glucose and insulin levels are positively correlated. Right after a meal, both are high. Glucose levels rise as glucose is extracted from the food that has been consumed, and insulin is high because its release is triggered by the anticipation and consumption of food. As time goes by without more food, glucose moves from the blood into other tissues, and insulin is no longer released, leading to lower levels of both substances in the blood. These lower levels of glucose and insulin should signal the need for more food (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="AWKV12PKJZH4Z6Z94462" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-section-id="YVCPPPG5Z8TJ6RLUU176" data-element-id="AWKV12PKJZH4Z6Z94462">Figure 7.16</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1586 rs_skip" id="AWKV12PKJZH4Z6Z94462" clrenderdata="[&quot;JERU0F6YGA2FJK4EG583&quot;]" id-sequence="661"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_f16-t2.png" data-width="455" data-height="288" data-alt="A line graph shows insulin reduction in type 2 diabetes.

High glucose levels occur in poorly managed diabetes because of either a lack of insulin production (type 1 diabetes) or the body’s resistance to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Without sufficient insulin activity, circulating glucose is unable to move out of the blood into the cells that need nutrients. If hunger results from low levels of circulating glucose, we would expect people with untreated diabetes to not feel very hungry, but this is not the case. Most people with diabetes who have high blood sugar report feeling<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_255" data-page="255"></a> hungry all the time. This makes sense when you consider that their cells are starving because of their inability to obtain glucose from the blood.

Stimulation of the LH typically initiates immediate eating. Low fat stores and leptin levels also activate the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, enhancing the body’s ability to digest and store nutrients. Metabolism, or the chemical reactions required by life, slows down, allowing nutrients to be stored rather than used up right away. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, initiation of feeding behavior, and reduction in metabolic rate allow the animal to find, eat, and store nutrients.</p> <p id="HBXV6T84RK7R0GADB243" id-sequence="678">As fat stores return to normal, leptin levels increase, and the feeding cycle tapers off. Unfortunately for the person trying to lose weight, the leptin system does a good job of defending a set point.

Currently, global agriculture produces 2,600 calories per person per day, which is expected to rise to 3,000 calories per person per day by 2030 (Caballero, 2007). With such a plentiful food supply, we can see why obesity is becoming a global problem even as starvation remains a serious concern in many parts of the world.</p> </div></div> <p id="TVESPJ7WPRKZM4R3S818" id-sequence="725">A cultural contribution to obesity is our contemporary, sedentary lifestyle, with many people spending hours sitting in front of televisions or computers. Humans use energy efficiently. At rest, we use only 12 kilocalories (usually described simply as calories) per pound per day. This means that the average 150-pound couch potato needs only about 1,800 calories of food per day. Even the most demanding activities require a remarkably small investment in resources. Cyclists competing in the challenging Tour de France use an average of 5,900 calories per day (<span class="citation" id="HRLNEL9TK87T6MH8S063" id-sequence="726">Armstrong &amp; Jenkins, 2000</span>). Meals at many chain restaurants contain more than 2,500 calories, the total daily requirement for a person who weighs 208 pounds and has a typical level of activity.</p> <p id="CEWDJ1ZW4WBNAYG0M230" id-sequence="727">To avoid starvation, our ancestors developed strong preferences for calorie-rich foods containing sugars and fats. When food supplies are limited, these preferences ensured that humans would spend the greatest amounts of time and energy seeking these rich sources of calories. Unfortunately, we retain these preferences today and continue to gravitate to sugary, fatty foods.</p> <p id="VAWRE0M8A72YSC1J4874" id-sequence="728">Zooming out from individual factors to the larger social context, we see that social factors also contribute to obesity. We apparently “keep track” of how we are doing by comparing our size to that of those in our social circles. Having an obese spouse raises your risk of obesity by 37%, and having obese friends raises your risk by 57% (<span class="citation" id="MGCYJCWLB59DDJ60G862" id-sequence="729">Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2007</span>).</p> <p id="BAVCRJXDEG5B4ATQV670" id-sequence="730">The path to a healthy weight can be difficult. Unfortunately, weight loss for our ancestors usually meant they were one step closer to death by starvation, and we are well prepared to prevent that occurrence. Once a person is obese, a new set point is established and subsequently staunchly defended. Even the surgical removal of fat, or liposuction, does not result in permanent weight loss because the fat removed by the process is replaced or redistributed to other parts of the body within one year (<span class="citation" id="XPJH4RQ9T68C9UQ6F475" id-sequence="731">Hernandez et al., 2011</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf158d rs_skip" id="JTETBFWVS76JS411X542" clrenderdata="[&quot;DKGN553BC5G6CRCY6851&quot;]" id-sequence="732"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf25-t2.png" data-width="257" data-height="362" data-alt="The average adult weighing 150 pounds needs only 1,800 calories per day.

If the dieter returns to previous eating habits, the lost weight is quickly regained. Successful diets should be viewed as lifestyle changes that are sustainable for an individual. For example, removing one sugared soft drink per day should result in about a 10-pound weight loss over the next year. It is essential for the dieter to avoid triggering mechanisms designed to prevent starvation, such as lowering metabolic rates. By keeping activity levels up and restricting weight loss to a pound or two per week at most, it is possible to slide weight loss under the radar of our vigilant weight maintenance systems.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_259" data-page="259"></a> <p id="TALBJ69F5ZU1BMZT3996" id-sequence="735">Efforts to use chemicals to control weight have been discouraging. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was not uncommon for American doctors to prescribe amphetamines for weight loss. Although amphetamines suppress appetite, their psychoactive and addictive properties make this approach less than desirable. More recently, several new medications have been approved for the treatment of obesity. One, orlistat (Xenical), reduces the absorption of fats by the digestive tract. The remaining approved medications target appetite mechanisms in the hypothalamus or prevent reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys. Medications do not “work on their own” but instead make it somewhat easier for obese individuals to maintain lifestyles that are more consistent with a healthy weight (<span class="citation" id="XAEH0TMMJTUBMNP3S817" id-sequence="736">Apovian et al., 2015</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf158e rs_skip" id="WLKX1SVNQYW1U3S9K776" clrenderdata="[&quot;JBRR0V7UXN555DS5B200&quot;]" id-sequence="737"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf26-t2.jpg" data-width="440" data-height="430" data-alt="Contrary to popular opinion, many people lose weight by dieting and are successful in maintaining their weight loss for years.

</span> is characterized by the maintenance of unusually low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted view of the body as obese (APA, 2013). <em>Anorexia</em> literally means “loss of appetite.” People with anorexia can show two patterns of behavior (APA, 2013). In the restricting type, people simply eat little food. In the bingeing-purging type, people combine restricted eating most of the time with behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa, which we discuss later.</p> <p id="RYYB39U96XE8V2884450" id-sequence="750">Anorexia nervosa is dramatic but rare, affecting about 0.4% of females and perhaps 0.04% of males (APA, 2013). Anorexia nervosa is one of the few psychological disorders that can kill, with up to 5% of people with the disorder dying per decade from causes related to the condition, which includes an elevated risk for suicide (APA, 2013). Other symptoms include interruption of normal menstruation in females, very dry and yellow skin, fine downy hair (lanugo) on the face and other parts of the body, increased sensitivity to cold, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems.</p> <p id="YBQLEZUFT4KWHS3AB381" id-sequence="751"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf106e" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf106e"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf106e" id="JDHY91UAY4CKULGN6348" id-sequence="752"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Bulimia nervosa</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="SRRX3DTX0B5X76JHB186" id-sequence="753">Bulimia nervosa</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">An eating disorder characterized by bingeing, purging, and having feelings of depression, disgust, and lost control.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf106e">

Anne Becker and her colleagues were observing eating patterns in the Fiji Islands when American television became available in 1995 (<span class="citation" id="VJDPR4DPQHUP4G8C3577" id-sequence="761">Becker, Burwell, Herzog, Hamburg, &amp; Gilman, 2002</span>). Prior to this time, Becker reported that dieting was unknown in this culture, which valued a “robust, well-muscled body” for both men and women. The Fijian language has a term for “going thin” that is used to express concern about someone who may be losing weight because of health problems. In the United States, people may say, “Have you lost weight? You look great!” In Fiji, a person is more likely to say, “Are you okay? You look like you’re going thin.”</p> <p id="GAKVXQYVHCTH4G9EK731" id-sequence="762">These cultural norms underwent nearly overnight change with the introduction of American television, with its frequent images of glamorous, ultrathin actresses. Suddenly, 74% of the adolescent girls in Becker et al.’s study reported themselves as being “too big or too fat.” Teens began to report dieting with the same frequency as their American counterparts, a radical shift from the researchers’ observations since 1988. Because Becker et al.’s data are correlational, we cannot conclude that watching television produced disordered eating in Fiji. However, the results are suggestive of strong cultural influences on patterns of disordered eating.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_thinkingscientifically narrative  rs_skip" id="BPNB2N43LT9QMY499681" label="thinkingscientifically" id-sequence="763"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Thinking Scientifically </span><h3 id="XCFRMKTXXQP2XB47A552" id-sequence="764">The Impact of Pro-Ana Websites</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="BPNB2N43LT9QMY499681_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="765"> <p id="PAUWMAS6MJ0EZBWYE126" id-sequence="766">Freedom of speech is a cherished right, especially in the United States, and we decide to restrict access to data reluctantly, as in the case of movie and video game rating systems.

Following a competition, testosterone continues to rise among the winners and temporarily decreases among the losers (<span class="citation" id="FCCEGNZ38XKBPNXQU606" id-sequence="810">Booth, Shelley, Mazur, Tharp, &amp; Kittok, 1989</span>). Simply observing a competition may influence testosterone levels. Men cheering for the successful Brazilian soccer team at the 1994 World Cup experienced increased testosterone levels, whereas men supporting the losing Italian team experienced a decrease (<span class="citation" id="ZVGS4AA3HXJ178CBG493" id-sequence="811">Bernhardt, Dabbs, Fielden, &amp; Lutter, 1998</span>). These fluctuations are more dramatic when taking the location of the venue into account. Losing at home produces a more dramatic decrease in testosterone than losing a game as the visiting team. This response to losing a competition at home may represent a remnant of our ancestors’ need to defend their territory. We can assume that losing a battle is catastrophic in any circumstance, but losing near your family and home makes them especially vulnerable to destruction.</p> <p id="WNTJJFFRL59QK0BTE102" id-sequence="812">Male testosterone levels are also influenced by relationship status. Men in stable, long-term relationships have lower testosterone levels than single men or men who are within a few years of divorce (Mazur &amp; Michalek, 1998). Men’s testosterone levels also drop significantly after the birth of a child (<span class="citation" id="XERLG0QF4MK1WZM5F350" id-sequence="813">Gettler, McDade, Feranil, &amp; Kuzawa, 2011</span>). These changes might reflect a feedback loop in which reproductive success signals a decrease in testosterone (<span class="citation" id="ZLFZU296UN9XRRV33753" id-sequence="814">Puts et al., 2015</span>). High testosterone levels interfere with pair-bonding and parental care by stimulating continued competition for mates and also have costs related to immune system functioning. It makes sense that the achievement of reproductive goals would lead to a reduction in the competitive behaviors and physical costs associated with high testosterone levels (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RRFSKD5UDVM7RCTDJ393" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-section-id="CTLY25D6HX3A3ZJXU704" data-element-id="RRFSKD5UDVM7RCTDJ393">Figure 7.22</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1591 rs_skip" id="RRFSKD5UDVM7RCTDJ393" clrenderdata="[&quot;GHPEY8TDMREDTKMRB244&quot;]" id-sequence="815"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_f22-t2.png" data-width="301" data-height="271" data-alt="A negative feedback loop shows that increase in testosterone levels leads to psychological factors which then leads to increased sexual behavior.

Prairie voles share parenting duties, but montane voles do not. Differences between the two types of vole in oxytocin and vasopressin were closely associated with the behavioral differences, with the prairie voles showing higher levels of both hormones than the montane voles. In one type of study, voles are allowed to mate, and then they are placed in a test box.

Both romantic love and sexual desire involve the insula. Sexual desire is correlated with activity toward the rear of the insula, consistent with other observations that the back of the brain is more involved with current and short-term sensory experiences.

Results showed that 97.7% of women and 97.8% of men identified themselves as straight, 1.5% of women and 1.8% of men identified themselves as homosexual, and 0.9% of women and 0.4% of men identified themselves as bisexual (Ward, Dahlhamer, Galinsky, &amp; Joestl, 2014).</p> <p id="JDALWXMP5AZTTHGYY401" id-sequence="852">It is likely that male and female sexual orientations emerge along different pathways (<span class="citation" id="QXGB0F93WM6CTYUA4887" id-sequence="853">Diamond, 2012</span>). Sexual orientation in males tends to be stable, acting like a compass, whereas females experience more fluidity in their sexual attractions over time. Women are more likely than men to experience physical arousal and desire for both sexes and to report changes in their degree of same-sex or other-sex attraction over time (<span class="citation" id="TGVZZ7P8YZXZTN4LK430" id-sequence="854">Diamond, 2012</span>).</p> <p id="MAMMX0H9Z0M9VBTDS201" id-sequence="855">Genes appear to influence sexual orientation, although the exact mechanisms with which they do so are not well understood and are likely to be quite complex. Like most human behaviors, sexual orientation is probably the result of an interaction between genetic factors and other aspects of the individual’s experience, which can include prenatal factors. To assess the genetic contribution to sexual orientation, researchers have compared rates of homosexuality in twins. If one identical male twin is homosexual, his twin has about a 50% chance of also being homosexual (Kirk, Bailey, &amp; Martin, 2000). Analyses of twin reports of the number of lifetime same-sex partners showed that sexual orientation is somewhat heritable for both males (0.34–0.39) and females (0.18–0.19) (<span class="citation" id="ALXZJXCBXUWERWJMV264" id-sequence="856">Långström, Rahman, Carlström, &amp; Lichtenstein, 2010</span>). Genome-wide linkage scans compare complete sets of DNA for individuals that differ in a trait. This type of study shows that male sexual orientation is associated with chromosome 8 and an area of the X chromosome known as xq28 (<span class="citation" id="QTDB9N3TZ52T85UGS628" id-sequence="857">Sanders et al., 2015</span>). As genetic methods continue to improve, it is likely that we will have a better understanding of the role of genes in sexual orientation in the future.</p> <p id="LGGYEXCRME9M0VFNM378" id-sequence="858">Among the other possible biological variables affecting sexual orientation are levels of prenatal, but not adult, sex hormones. Women with a condition known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) experience high prenatal levels of male hormones. Consequently, they are often born with masculinized external genitalia, are more likely to describe themselves as “tomboys,” and are more likely to engage in lesbian or bisexual behavior (Meyer-Bahlburg, Dolezal, Baker, &amp; New, 2008). However, most women with CAH are heterosexual, just as most lesbian and bisexual women do not have a history of CAH or similar conditions.</p> <p id="PZQJYQL8G2MR44KZR230" id-sequence="859">An interesting clue to the origin of sexual orientation arises from the observation that birth order influences the odds that a man is homosexual. Men who have older brothers from the same mother are more likely to be gay than men who have no siblings, younger siblings only, or older sisters (<span class="citation" id="AAQXMAR1CHVAVZ1AC809" id-sequence="860">Balthazart, 2011</span>; <span class="citation" id="GKVZB7Y3WG9749UCN852" id-sequence="861"> Blanchard, 1997</span>). Theoretically, carrying a male fetus could provoke a mother’s immune response, which would become stronger with each successive male fetus she carries. Her immune response could influence the development of her fetus by altering significant hormonal processes.</p> <p id="THTGZDQHPEPLRHD3C318" id-sequence="862">Several structures in the brain are known to be different in males and females and also seem to differ between homosexual and heterosexual males. Among these is a small cluster of neurons located in the hypothalamus known as the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH; see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="SYAWHLN0T7U05Q0T3996" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-section-id="CTLY25D6HX3A3ZJXU704" data-element-id="SYAWHLN0T7U05Q0T3996">Figure 7.25</a>). There are four separate nuclei in INAH. Two of these, INAH-2 and INAH-3, are notably larger in males than in females (<span class="citation" id="CJVX6ZUE0PAU3PSDZ051" id-sequence="863">Allen, Hines, Shryne, &amp; Gorski, 1989</span>). The exact function of these nuclei in humans is unknown, although animal research suggests that they participate in sexual behavior. Building on this research about differences between the brains of men and women, Simon LeVay asked whether INAH-3 might be different in heterosexual and homosexual males. After examining the brains of more than 40 individuals, LeVay (1991) concluded that INAH-3 in homosexual men was about two to three times smaller than in heterosexual men, or about the same size as typically found in women.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1596 rs_skip" id="SYAWHLN0T7U05Q0T3996" clrenderdata="[&quot;TQSZ9330EVXCFDB27522&quot;]" id-sequence="864"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_f25-t2.png" data-width="499" data-height="294" data-alt="An illustration shows cross-section of the human brain with hypothalamus labeled.

The homosexual individuals in his sample had all died from AIDS. Otherwise, there would be little reason to note sexual orientation on a person’s medical records. Although it is unlikely that AIDS would produce this type of change in the brain, LeVay could not rule out that possibility based on his data. LeVay also raised the possibility that engaging in homosexual behavior might influence INAH-3, even in the adult, although he gave little credence to that possibility. Nonetheless, LeVay’s research had a profound effect on the way psychologists and the public looked at sexual orientation.

The role of individual achievement motivation in predicting performance has been of great interest in the fields of education, management, and athletics.</p> <p id="LUVLXSVN6G3JGT1MF332" id-sequence="913">Many psychologists have recognized that individual differences in achievement motivation seem similar to personality traits, which we discuss in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a> (<span class="citation" id="PYCABM7GNUHP0LJAM317" id-sequence="914">Elliot &amp; Murayama, 2008</span>). A trait is a stable characteristic that shows relatively little variation over time. However, traits also typically interact with situations. An introverted person might seem more introverted at a big party than when out to dinner with one friend. According to this more complex view, a person’s trait achievement motivation interacts with the opportunities present in the environment (<span class="citation" id="GVNV53N6ERUVK8YX8901" id-sequence="915">Hart &amp; Albarracin, 2009</span>). For example, achieving excellence might be viewed as an alternative to having fun or enjoying leisure time. High-achieving people do not dislike fun but are prepared to avoid or postpone some fun to meet their achievement goals.<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_269" data-page="269"></a> Low-achieving people may be perfectly capable of success but, for a variety of reasons, have simply prioritized fun alternatives and inhibited the achievement alternatives.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1599 rs_skip" id="VRABYNNDDNPFWBZ86173" clrenderdata="[&quot;SJSZ5FBNAD0L5NHKY107&quot;]" id-sequence="916"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf32-t2.jpg" data-width="430" data-height="279" data-alt="A photo shows physically disabled racing in his wheelchair."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="PVPGCD1EQ1JKF1PWT643" id-sequence="917"><p>A person’s trait level of achievement motivation interacts with the opportunities to achieve available in the environment.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:430px;height:279px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_07_unf32-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows physically disabled racing in his wheelchair." width="430" height="279" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">CHEN WS/ <a target="_blank" id="BKYG8T5UC20UQ3KQV519" name="BKYG8T5UC20UQ3KQV519" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="918">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="WJJQ9AY84BLAC6QMS856" id-sequence="919">Carol <span class="citation" id="PGZDA7AMWB7LCJK5N889" id-sequence="920"> Dweck (2012)</span> argues that achievement motivation is influenced by people’s beliefs about their own abilities. Individuals with a growth mindset, or a belief that capacities can be developed, outperform individuals with a fixed mindset, or a belief that capacities do not change. In other words, a person with a fixed mindset might say “I’m not good at math,” while a person with a growth mindset might say “math is hard, but I’m getting better at it.” Individuals with a fixed mindset avoid challenges, become defensive when criticized, and feel envious when they see someone performing better. In contrast, individuals with a growth mindset focus on the processes that lead to success, such as hard work and trying out new strategies. Instead of catastrophes, mistakes are viewed as important sources of information eventually leading to a solution.</p> <p id="JWRANCYGX3UYT5SAZ361" id-sequence="921">A number of practical implications emerge from the study of achievement motivation. Many teachers, managers, and coaches emphasize competition, such as sales contests, as a way to promote achievement. While this competitive approach works well for people who are high in achievement motivation, it might not work so well for those who are lower in this trait (<span class="citation" id="XFLMVQ7VHY7NXCB0N402" id-sequence="922">Hart &amp; Albarracin, 2009</span>). For lower achievers, messages that emphasize the fun and relaxing aspects of a task might be more likely to elicit the best outcomes. Dweck cautions that her work is often misinterpreted by teachers and parents, who claim “everyone is smart” or praise children for working hard even when they’re not making any progress. She advises that praising strategies and tying those to the outcome of the child’s efforts is more effective (“You tried different things and figured out the solution”).</p> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="923"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="926"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="927" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="928" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="NEPX0YJ57BTYZBVAC685" id-sequence="929"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">7-4d</span> <span class="headingText">Motivational Priorities</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="DYJLUM5WWJUNFKPX8252_content" id-sequence="930"> <p id="WJDWR4ETWH22TR1G1587" id-sequence="931">We have discussed several different motivations, from hunger to sex to affiliation to achievement.

Approach and avoidance differ in valence or natural attractiveness, with approach involving positive and desirable outcomes and avoidance involving negative and undesirable outcomes. A particular situation might stimulate us to engage in a behavior to approach an outcome, avoid one, or possibly do both simultaneously.

If you don’t stay late at work, your boss will think you’re a lazy employee, but if you do stay late at work, your partner will be angry.

In one classic study, young healthy men were given approximately 1,500 calories per day for 6 months, which resulted in a loss of about 25% of their normal body weight (<span class="citation" id="VHAP3A259RTKXHDC3274" id-sequence="948">Keys, Brozek, Henschel, Mickelsen, &amp; Taylor, 1950</span>).

Aggression takes many forms, but bullying research focuses on two types: reactive and proactive aggression (<span class="citation" id="YHDB4REEDKYXEUE34446" id-sequence="977">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1996</span>). Reactive aggression involves retaliation for a perceived harm, whereas proactive aggression occurs without provocation and is usually goal-oriented. The goals might be dominating another person or enhancing one’s own reputation or popularity among peers. Research on face-to-face bullying shows that proactive aggression is the norm (<span class="citation" id="GEFWX366AGYXCGUBZ998" id-sequence="978">Camodeca, Goossens, Terwogt, &amp; Schuengel, 2002</span>). Will this finding also be characteristic of cyberbullying?</p> <p id="KWGCVPPDMNUUV4UQF150" id-sequence="979">In cyberbullying, reactive aggression might take the form of retaliation for behaviors or online content that is viewed as insulting. This process can lead quickly to an escalating “flame war.” Proactive aggression might take the form of hijacking a person’s identity or setting up a fake social media account used to harm the person. Although relatively little research has been done in this area, existing studies point to reactive motivation as the most common form of aggression in cyberbullying (<span class="citation" id="UQVB3MJSWRAN8TMZN408" id-sequence="980">Shapka &amp; Law, 2013</span>). In this sense, then, cyberbullying is not similar to its face-to-face counterpart. Interventions aimed at reducing proactive aggression in cyberbullying, based on similar interventions for face-to-face bullying, might not produce the desired effects.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf159e rs_skip" id="CFBV7WKJNDGMZPU3N284" clrenderdata="[&quot;QDGZB2JHZ5JYVN4HQ558&quot;]" id-sequence="981"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_07_unf42-t2.png" data-width="518" data-height="326" data-alt="An E S P N publicist states that the Orange Bowl posted a 7.2 overnight rating giving the 4 game B C S average on E S P N an 8.6 rating, up 15% from last year’s 4 game average.

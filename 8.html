As shown in the large image to the left, they removed most of Molaison’s hippocampus in both hemispheres, along with some of the surrounding neural tissue. As a result, Molaison’s memory functions declined dramatically, although his personality and intellect remained intact.</p> <p id="LAZN74L75TKR39M2M229" id-sequence="30">Zooming in to consider the results of this type of surgery, we can ask what scientists learned from their study of Molaison. Brenda Milner, followed by her student Suzanne Corkin, studied Molaison for more than four decades. His case produced a string of surprises, which we discuss in more detail later in this chapter. For example, certain structures in the brain are important for memory, but more so for some types of memories than for others. Some tasks we can perform automatically; that is, we can remember how to do something without remembering that we know how to do it.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15ef rs_skip" id="QFCXD5JLX0F18VQNP812" clrenderdata="[&quot;SDQEEXR3ATMXB6TWM110&quot;]" id-sequence="31"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf01-t2.jpg" data-width="303" data-height="252" data-alt="Photograph of Henry Molaison."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="DNSX3P5Y5DNSH4E6R663" id-sequence="32"><p>Photograph of Henry Molaison.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:303px;height:252px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_09_unf01-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Photograph of Henry Molaison." width="303" height="252" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Photos of H.M. by Suzanne Corkin.

According to people who knew him, he was a nice man who loved animals, watching trains, and doing crossword puzzles. Even though Molaison was the subject of decades of study, many questions about him remain. Why did he seem less affected by pain than<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_319" data-page="319"></a> other people? Why was he accurately able to rate the intensity of an odor but unable to tell the difference between a rose and something rotten? Although his ability to learn new facts following his surgery was remarkably impaired, why did he know scattered facts from the following decade? Which of these observations shows the effects of his surgery? Of his accident? Of his seizures?</p> <p id="ZHHSR45ZK3YRJ489L022" id-sequence="34">Zooming out still farther, we ask ourselves how our social interactions would be affected by being unable to remember new people we have met. Molaison remembered people, such as his surgeon, whom he had met before his surgery, but he never learned to recognize Milner, Corkin, or the other scientists who met him later, even though he saw them regularly for decades. He retained a genuine concern for other people and took great pride in his case helping science, but it is hard to imagine that his life was not somewhat lonely and socially isolated.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15f0 rs_skip" id="QBVDSUKXX4KUFFJ27682" clrenderdata="[&quot;RNUST8YV8BRRGMZ9Q100&quot;]" id-sequence="35"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="294" data-height="252" data-alt="The careful slicing of Henry Molaison’s preserved brain took more than 53 straight hours and was broadcast live on the Internet."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="PUCPMJWCCNWP93Q6Y143" id-sequence="36"><p>The careful slicing of Henry Molaison’s preserved brain took more than 53 straight hours and was broadcast live on the Internet.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:294px;height:252px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_09_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="The careful slicing of Henry Molaison’s preserved brain took more than 53 straight hours and was broadcast live on the Internet." width="294" height="252" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Dr. Jacopo Annese, The Brain Observatory </div> </div></div></div> <p id="GPHCLU1ED6F26KRPK441" id-sequence="37">We often think of memory as something we need to succeed on exams, but in this chapter, you will learn that memory means much more to our human experience.

</span> of memories in the brain can last anywhere from fractions of a second (sensory memory) to several seconds (short-term and working memory) to indefinitely (long-term memory). Storage in the mind differs from storage of information in your computer in one important respect. Computers store encoded information in reliable and unvarying ways, such as putting socks in a drawer or papers in a file. What you retrieve is identical to what was stored. In contrast, human memory does not generate exact records. Instead, bits of information are stored that are later reconstructed into usable memories. Although this process typically results in a useful memory, errors and distortions can occur.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_320" data-page="320"></a> <p id="NNHNYYXGCETY2KLFW230" id-sequence="73">The culmination of the memory process is the <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf112a" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf112a"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf112a" id="HLRZ4PMTM16VDFXHW021" id-sequence="74"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">retrieval</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="WLCL3XEA4E94PCMHA932" id-sequence="75">retrieval</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">The recovery of stored information.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf112a">

</span> of stored information. As you have no doubt experienced, storing information is no guarantee that you can find the information again when you need it. Later in this chapter, we will discuss ways that memory retrieval can fail in detail. Two of the most common causes of retrieval failure are interference and stress. For example, we seem to know all the answers when watching <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> in the safety of our homes, but when put on the spot, we might be lucky to remember our names. Fortunately, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the brain’s memory functions may be one of the more practical topics for students that we cover in psychology. Once you understand how memory works, you will have an easier time ensuring that your study habits maximize your performance in school.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="76"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="79"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="80" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="81" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="RUEA99PFTXKGV1M6A342" id-sequence="82"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-1b</span> <span class="headingText">Memory Provides an Adaptive Advantage</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="RBTPC10T4NL2J253M416_content" id-sequence="83"> <p id="BMHUJ94JYGEFXCYZD651" id-sequence="84">Evolutionary psychologists view memory as “a component of a neural machine designed to use information acquired in the past to coordinate an organism’s behavior in the present” (<span class="citation" id="GYCUFV2LEVSHGMBNC329" id-sequence="85">Klein, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2002</span>, p. 308). The evolution of memory allowed animals to use information from the past to respond quickly to immediate challenges, a monumental advance in the ability to survive. Instead of reacting to each predator or source of food as a new experience, an animal with the ability to remember past encounters with similar situations would save precious reaction time.</p> <p id="KVZCSCMUC0Z9HE9MM299" id-sequence="86">As we discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-chapter-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-element-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455">Chapter 3</a>, useful adaptations often come with a price, such as the unwieldy antlers of the male deer that require energy to build yet help the deer fight successfully for mates. The development of a memory system is no exception to this rule. Forming memories requires energy. For memory systems to flourish within the animal kingdom, the survival advantages needed to outweigh the energy costs. Given the 81 years or so of human life expectancy, it would be difficult to demonstrate the energy costs of memory in people, but we can observe the costs in a simpler organism, the fruit fly <em>(Drosophila)</em>, which has a life expectancy of only 10 to 18 days. Fruit flies are capable of learning classically conditioned associations between odors and electric shock (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>). After experiencing pairings of odor and shock, the flies fly away from the odor 24 hours later (<span class="citation" id="HJLLXW3HU4D73MS40411" id-sequence="87">Mery &amp; Kawecki, 2005</span>). However, to form memories about odor and shock, the flies must use more energy than they use for activities that do not require memory. The flies that remembered how to avoid shock died about 4 hours earlier than flies that did not form memories. Nearly all animals have the capability of forming memories despite the high-energy costs, which is a testament to memory’s benefits to survival.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="88"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="91"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="92" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="93" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="RZULP531VTBLBLP2H103" id-sequence="94"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-2</span> <span class="headingText">How Are Memories Processed?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="NEXX7035FULQUJPWK738_content" id-sequence="95"> <p id="XVFKFS5LFNB40ZWUN227" id-sequence="96">Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968, 1971) proposed one of the most influential models of memory.

Visual codes are used for the temporary storage of information about visual images (<span class="citation" id="PTRRLZ9MTER2PTS7Q705" id-sequence="117">Baddeley, Eysenck, &amp; Anderson, 2009</span>). Haptic codes are used to process touch and other body senses. Acoustic codes represent sounds and words. Input from different sensory systems remains separate in sensory memory, and although these different sensory streams are processed similarly, there are also some differences. Acoustic codes, or echoic memories, last longer than visual codes, or iconic memories, possibly to meet our needs to hear entire words and phrases before we can understand spoken language.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15f4 rs_skip" id="LDBT4NZT1B1BVWGBP156" clrenderdata="[&quot;WFLJ18A9CM1EPKWQZ365&quot;]" id-sequence="118"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf04-t3.jpg" data-width="645" data-height="403"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf04-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="370" data-alt="Both brains and computers feature the ability to store memories with one critical difference: The computer stores exact copies of data, but the brain does not.

These limitations actually make short-term memory an ideal solution for the tasks that we ask it to complete. The brief duration of short-term memories ensures that room is freed regularly for incoming information. Most tasks for which we use short-term memory require us to search its contents to find the right information.<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_324" data-page="324"></a> If short-term memory were capable of holding dozens of pieces of information instead of nine or fewer, this search process would be lengthy and difficult. It is also convenient to have a mechanism that allows you to use information and then discard it. You may not wish to devote precious room in your memory to the telephone number of a plumber you need only once or twice. Short-term memory allows us to use information without overburdening our storage capacities.</p> <p id="CWSHQ2GEQZ6A8DX2N408" id-sequence="165">Nonetheless, it is often desirable to expand our capacity for information in short-term memory.

If the last four digits of your friend’s phone number are “one,” “five,” “seven,” and “nine,” she could reduce these four bits to two by saying “fifteen seventy-nine.” Trying to remember the following sequence of letters—FBIIRSCIAEPA—appears to be an insurmountable task. After all, remembering 12 letters lies outside the capacity of short-term memory. The task is greatly simplified by chunking the letters into meaningful batches of common abbreviations—FBI IRS CIA EPA. Now you have only four meaningful bits to remember rather than 12, which is safely within the capacities of short-term memory. Failure to use chunking as a strategy occurs frequently in people with verbal learning disabilities (<span class="citation" id="JXXN6VK49YLFTCJT5551" id-sequence="169">Koeda, Seki, Uchiyama, &amp; Sadato, 2011</span>). In the absence of chunking, each item is processed as a single, unrelated bit of information, which rapidly overwhelms the capacity of short-term memory.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15fb rs_skip" id="ZCRCJQDBEHMC9LZ6E512" clrenderdata="[&quot;PXMAR8350QKTJ8UDQ384&quot;]" id-sequence="170"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf09-t2.png" data-width="245" data-height="893" data-alt="The images show the logos of the three different departments.

For example, study participants could read a list of numbers and then read a paragraph. This task should quickly overwhelm the limited capacity of short-term memory because reading the paragraph should displace the earlier list of numbers. However, this outcome was not what the researchers observed. Participants had no difficulty remembering the numbers, suggesting that the numbers were stored separately from the words in the paragraph. After further exploration of the types of information that could be maintained separately in short-term memory, four components were proposed (<span class="citation" id="AFZYYH3WPPX64F5QM723" id-sequence="182">Baddeley et al., 2009</span>): a phonological loop, a visuospatial sketch pad, a central executive, and an episodic buffer.</p> <p id="RGEK06XED7ZNZA71S889" id-sequence="183">The phonological loop is the working memory component responsible for verbal and auditory information. As you repeat your friend’s phone number while reaching for your phone, you are using your phonological loop. The visuospatial sketch pad holds visual and spatial information. When you describe the route from your friend’s dorm to your favorite coffee shop where you plan to hold your study session, you use your visuospatial sketch pad to describe the way. The central executive manages the work of the other components by directing attention to particular tasks (<span class="citation" id="MDZR431CV76WXZDMZ948" id-sequence="184">Baddeley, 1996</span>). Divided attention, which we discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-chapter-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-element-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599">Chapter 5</a>, requires the skills of the central executive. While discussing the route to the coffee shop with your friend (phonological loop), you visualize the route (visuospatial sketch pad), and your central executive parcels out the right amount of attention to allow you to do both tasks well.</p> <p id="JDEKEQ0HUN69W5XES345" id-sequence="185">The episodic buffer provides a mechanism for combining information stored in long-term memory, which we discuss in the <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XAEGJ3CXMY465PKVB773" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="XAEGJ3CXMY465PKVB773" data-element-id="XAEGJ3CXMY465PKVB773">Long-Term Memory</a>, with the active processing taking<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_326" data-page="326"></a> place in working memory.

When we look at written words we want to remember, we can attend to many levels of detail: the visual appearance of the word (font, all caps, and number of letters), the sound of the word, the meaning of the word, and the personal relevance of the word. These characteristics can be placed along a continuum of depth of processing from shallow to deep, with the encoding of the appearance of a word requiring less processing and effort than the encoding of the sound of a word, which in turn requires less processing and effort than the encoding of the meaning or personal relevance of a word. According to the levels of processing theory, words encoded according to meaning would be easier to remember than words encoded according to their visual appearance because encoding meaningfulness produces a deeper level of attention and processing (<span class="citation" id="WVTD015PMY2MAFF90690" id-sequence="206">Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975</span>).</p> <p id="JPTYK48M79CY5L2GX529" id-sequence="207">In one study designed to test the levels of processing theory, participants recalled more words when their instructions elicited the encoding of word meanings than when they were<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_327" data-page="327"></a> instructed to determine more surface features of each word, such as whether it appeared in capital letters (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="EDKKHW583TQ82U8MC181" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="XAEGJ3CXMY465PKVB773" data-element-id="EDKKHW583TQ82U8MC181">Figure 9.6</a>) (<span class="citation" id="FPJC6Y03T4308WY9Y662" id-sequence="208">Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975</span>).

However, the processing theory is not very specific about the meaning of deep or shallow processing. How would we apply this approach to evaluate participants’ recall for music, touch, or visual images? Further work on this theory needs to identify what determines depth of processing during encoding.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15fe rs_skip" id="RWQCLYVSYFDWF51ZB188" clrenderdata="[&quot;CREDSE7WJ2LKBAHA9416&quot;]" id-sequence="210"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf11-t2.jpg" data-width="393" data-height="252" data-alt="The accumulated knowledge of a long life, such as this Australian aborigine tribal elder’s familiarity with his harsh surroundings, probably meant the difference between life and death for many of our ancestors.

The questions pointed to surface features (Is the word in capital letters?), acoustic features (Does the word rhyme with another word?), or semantic features (Does the word make sense in this sentence?). Theoretically, deciding whether a word is in capital letters takes less processing than deciding whether it rhymes with another word, which in turn takes less processing than thinking about its meaning to answer the sentence question.

Semantic memories contain general knowledge about the world, whereas episodic memories include more specific information about events, objects, and people. Semantic memory, as we will see later in this chapter, is organized according to categories. For example, we have a category for birds that contains our semantic knowledge of birds. Episodic memory, in contrast, is organized as a timeline. To answer a question from episodic memory, we often use time as a cue: “When I was in the eighth grade, my family took a vacation at the beach.” Semantic knowledge originates from others, such as your professors, or from repeated experience: “The ocean is colder in California than in Florida because every time I’ve gone to the beach in either location, this is what I have observed.” An episodic memory can result from a single, personal experience. Finally, the two types of memories serve different purposes. Semantic memory provides us with an objective understanding of our world, whereas episodic memory provides a reference point for our subjective experience of the self.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1604 rs_skip" id="EZNQKPK7XLGF7Z9L9096" clrenderdata="[&quot;VNLXBYSLSNM3B40SJ464&quot;]" id-sequence="267"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf14-t3.jpg" data-width="915" data-height="514"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf14-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="333" data-alt="You might have semantic memories that tell you about the characteristics of Labrador retrievers and episodic memories about the day you chose your first puppy.

You could form an episodic memory of where you were when you stored a specific semantic memory. A colleague was introduced to a student’s parents as follows: “Mom, Dad, this is Professor Jones. He’s the one I told you about who taught us that rats can’t barf.” Not only did the student retain a semantic memory about rat behavior (which incidentally is true and is relevant to understanding the classical conditioning of taste aversion in rats), but the student correctly retained an episodic memory of when and where the fact was learned.</p> <p id="JDLQLMZFYLVMVY9D8616" id-sequence="271">We can see that semantic and episodic memories interact dynamically to provide a complete picture of the past. Our semantic knowledge of the relative temperatures of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans depends on the personal experiences of either hearing the fact in a geology classroom or vacationing on both coasts of the United States. At the same time, we use our semantic knowledge to interpret our episodic memories. Without semantic knowledge of the meanings of the words ocean, temperature, Atlantic, and Pacific, we would be unable to organize our experience into a coherent conclusion—the ocean is colder in California than in Florida.</p> <p id="NSSBVQQRKYG13ZF0N206" id-sequence="272">This blending of semantic and episodic memories characterizes <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1136" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1136"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1136" id="FSTWWT4G420KEWTKQ868" id-sequence="273"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">autobiographical memories</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="SDZN8AL1YMH3WY2FC005" id-sequence="274">autobiographical memories</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Semantic or episodic memories that reference the self.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1136">

Autobiographical memories can contain factual, semantic aspects of personal experience without episodic aspects. You might know you were born in Pasadena, California, but you would not have any memory of being born. However, your autobiographical memories of Pasadena might also include episodic memories of attending the Rose Parade on New Year’s Day as a child, complete with images of the sights, sounds, and emotions of that experience.</p> <p id="YGXVQZH387P82ZQ6N099" id-sequence="276">A small number of people have been identified as having a rare condition known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) (<span class="citation" id="KTNECSN0VP38YPCSR760" id-sequence="277">Ally, Hussey, &amp; Donahue, 2013</span>; <span class="citation" id="TLNJF3CZLQWNR9HJC207" id-sequence="278"> LePort et al., 2012</span>; <span class="citation" id="RKQG6NXQTYCVG858L129" id-sequence="279"> Parker, Cahill, &amp; McGaugh, 2006</span>).

Consider the differences between showing somebody how to use scissors and writing an essay about how to use scissors. Which would be easier? Explaining in words how to use scissors, particularly for a person who had never seen a pair of scissors, would be quite a challenge. In contrast, few of us experience difficulties demonstrating procedures (<span class="citation" id="MAPMF7WXDPVULY9VN214" id-sequence="300">Squire, 1987</span>).</p> <p id="QJJXZJBNA3BT4BJ5V045" id-sequence="301">One great advantage of procedural memories is their ability to automate our performance. When a novice driver first learns to operate a car with a manual transmission, significant conscious effort is required to remember the<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_332" data-page="332"></a> correct sequence—clutch, gas, shift. Once the skill is well learned, the driver is far less aware of this sequence; the person “just drives.” When procedures become automatic, we are free to direct our limited capacities for divided attention to other aspects of the task. A musician who has mastered the notes in a difficult piece can direct attention to the finer points of expression and phrasing. Unfortunately, if a procedure is learned incorrectly, such as a bad golf swing, considerable effort must be expended to fix the swing, which slows performance. The golfer must put in sufficient practice time to make the new, correct swing automatic.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1606 rs_skip" id="ETCADKR4XPNU3EF6H199" clrenderdata="[&quot;LBMBSEUSSGRVS8CB7793&quot;]" id-sequence="302"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf16-t2.jpg" data-width="264" data-height="383" data-alt="It might have been years since this grandfather last put on a pair of ice skates, but to help his granddaughter learn to skate, he’s willing to get back out on the ice.

It also explains why few star athletes go on to be good coaches.

Reaction time, in the form of hitting one key for real words and another for nonwords, is the dependent variable. When the two stimuli are related words (e.g., <em>doctor–nurse</em>), reaction time for deciding that nurse is a real word is faster than when the stimuli are unrelated words (e.g., <em>butter–nurse</em>) (<span class="citation" id="ZGTL5BUMYXVWCEFGF285" id-sequence="312">Meyer &amp; Schvanevelt, 1971</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1607 rs_skip" id="GYMXJVBCHQX781A1R611" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZKFASE0A5VWG4JWLH501&quot;]" id-sequence="313"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_09_f09-t3.png" data-width="713" data-height="245"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_f09-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="196" data-alt="Priming has been depicted with a table and a bar graph.

Nonreal words are made by switching one letter from a real word, like plame from flame or lork from fork. Pairs of real words are either related to each other by meaning or not. The participants’ reaction time in this task (b) demonstrates that participants respond faster to related word pairs (bread–butter) than to unrelated word pairs (nurse–butter).

For example, even though avocados and oranges are both examples of the concept “fruit,” most people have a closer link in their memories between “orange” and “fruit” than between “avocado” and “fruit.” If asked whether an avocado or an orange is a fruit, reaction time to the second statement would be faster.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_335" data-page="335"></a> <p id="UQTE2G8LQWU4VHH0Y709" id-sequence="442">The spreading activation model does an excellent job of accounting for the results of the lexical decision experiments described earlier. Using the spreading activation model, the first word activates a concept. This activation spreads to connected concepts and properties. For closely related concepts such as “doctor” and “nurse,” activating the “doctor” concept would activate the “nurse” concept even before the person sees the word <em>nurse</em>, allowing a quick decision to be made as soon as the word appears. In contrast, with unrelated words like <em>butter</em> and <em>nurse</em>, the “nurse” concept would not be activated until the word actually appears, resulting in a relatively slower decision.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="443"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="446"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="447" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="448" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="PPSZQAJYHCUKFQWE9841" id-sequence="449"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-4b</span> <span class="headingText">Inferences: Using Schemas</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="VBPEJ6YHPB0FDXC5W903_content" id-sequence="450"> <p id="BBED4YJE1KPLVY9PA982" id-sequence="451">Frederic Bartlett (1932/1967) observed that memory does not work like a video recording of events.

First you arrange things into different groups depending on their makeup. Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities that is the next step, otherwise you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo any particular endeavor. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important, but complications from doing too many can easily arise. A mistake can be expensive as well. The manipulation of the appropriate mechanisms should be self-explanatory, and we need not dwell on it here. At first the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then one never can tell.

</span> is any stimulus that helps you access target information. Most students find recognition tasks such as true–false or matching exam items relatively easy. These tasks provide complete cues (the correct information is on the page in front of you). All you need to do is make a judgment about how well the presented information matches what is stored in memory. Compared to recognition tasks, recall tasks, such as essay exams, require an additional step. Information must be retrieved from memory and then recognized as correct, a process known as generate–recognize (<span class="citation" id="TBLUEFQCD0WV8RFK3621" id-sequence="533">Guynn et al., 2014</span>). Recall tasks provide far fewer cues than recognition tasks and are typically more difficult as a result.</p> <p id="KJDLT4SC53RTCSZUV081" id-sequence="534">In addition to the amount of information provided, what makes a stimulus an effective cue? The most effective cues are those we generate ourselves, a finding that students might find particularly useful. In one experiment, one group of students wrote down 3 words of their choosing for every 1 of 600 words they were expected to learn, while another group studied the same 600 words accompanied by 3 words for each term selected by another person (Mäntylä &amp; Nilsson, 1988). Although recall in the second group was an excellent 55%, the students who selected their own retrieval cues remembered a remarkable 90% of the words. In a later section on improving your memory, we will emphasize the benefits of incorporating your experience when forming new memories. If you are able to put concepts to be learned in your own words and associate them with personal experiences, they will be easier to remember.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1613 rs_skip" id="EFRFSSMBHXRDK6XQ5138" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZBWRQ3T02C64QZ2QQ819&quot;]" id-sequence="535"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf27-t2.jpg" data-width="315" data-height="450" data-alt="The popularity of memory games, such as Trivial Pursuit, probably results from the rewarding feeling we get when we retrieve a sought-after memory."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="WDCEFQ6ZBDNBKXG3P402" id-sequence="536"><p>The popularity of memory games, such as Trivial Pursuit, probably results from the rewarding feeling we get when we retrieve a sought-after memory.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:315px;height:450px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_09_unf27-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="The popularity of memory games, such as Trivial Pursuit, probably results from the rewarding feeling we get when we retrieve a sought-after memory." width="315" height="450" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">STOCK4B/Photoshot </div> </div></div></div> <div class="container dependent mt_diversevoicesinpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="NGDKQS4BPUHF9F5ZB065" label="diversevoicesinpsychology" id-sequence="537"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Diverse Voices in Psychology</span><h3 id="KEHG2HFTMTUHUGXP0558" id-sequence="538">What Is the “Own-Race Bias” in Memory for Faces?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="NGDKQS4BPUHF9F5ZB065_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="539"> <p id="TNDEU5CFWV7Q5VK24575" id-sequence="540">Following the Misidentification of five innocent African-American men by a white eyewitness in 1971, William Haythorn was inspired to ask whether cross-racial identifications were as accurate as same-race identifications (<span class="citation" id="TPCKRVQFRJRHKY508535" id-sequence="541">Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001</span>).

</span>, or the building of a memory out of the stored bits by blending retrieved information with new content present in working memory (Bartlett, 1932/1967). When you retrieve the target information, you are reconstructing something sensible to fit the occasion, as opposed to simply reproducing some memory trace. If the memories are rather fresh, such as when you are describing an automobile accident to a police officer, this process might produce updates in the original memory that will then be reconsolidated into long-term memory. Changes you make in the original memory will be stored as the new “truth.” However, if you are recalling a memory from a more remote time, less updating is likely to occur (Gräff et al., 2014).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1616 rs_skip" id="GPXHGY5GU7N7LAK5A648" clrenderdata="[&quot;RJZPEFTTTPWBMHEWY296&quot;]" id-sequence="584"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf29-t2.jpg" data-width="295" data-height="420" data-alt="Drugs, including the caffeine in coffee, can produce strong context-dependent effects on memory.

These aspects are emphasized and perhaps exaggerated for even greater effect, and the new, more exciting story replaces the original version in long-term memory. Fish become larger, vacations become more exciting, and heroes become more heroic. When participants in a study were asked to repeat a complicated story on several occasions, they tended to simplify the story, highlight some aspects more than others, and adjust the story to fit their worldviews (Bartlett, 1932/1967). Such alterations probably form the basis of mythology. In the retelling of the adventures of Odysseus or King Arthur, accounts of the original true events are lost or hopelessly distorted.</p> <p id="GVQMYL8NFYHQ0BHY5812" id-sequence="588">Most of us believe that our memories, especially for important life events, are relatively accurate. Elizabeth Loftus set out to evaluate the reliability of eyewitness testimony in courtroom settings and discovered that memories are rather flexible. In one experiment, participants watched a video of an automobile accident and answered a number of questions about what they had seen (<span class="citation" id="XMFADKKD4QN78N4M4731" id-sequence="589">Loftus &amp; Palmer, 1974</span>). One group heard the question “How fast was the white sports car going while traveling along the country road?” while the other group heard the same question with a slight addition—”How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road?” There was no barn in the video, but when participants were asked 1 week later whether they had seen a barn, 20% of those who had heard the barn question answered “yes,” while fewer than 5% of the other participants did so.

It may be quite unsettling to realize that memories are open to change and revision and that those distinct and confident childhood memories we cherish may be somewhat inaccurate or even flat out wrong. However, it also doesn’t make sense to think that we would evolve a system of memory that was usually wrong. Instead, fuzzy trace theory suggests that we use precious resources to form different types of memories based on our needs, ranging from verbatim, or exact accounts, to gist, which means we retain the general idea of events (<span class="citation" id="YTMMQ4XKJCVLPZHHD621" id-sequence="598">Reyna, 2008</span>). We use gist when a relatively vague level of information is sufficient because this is a more efficient use of resources. We use the more energy-intensive verbatim memories for situations that require detailed, accurate recall, such as remembering the periodic table of the elements in your chemistry class. This system works well for us most of the time, but later in this chapter, we will see how relying on gist instead of retrieving verbatim information can lead to false memories (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="HDKLTM4Z0QCSNSS6S617" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="YMUXAE8HRTD6FC5XP396" data-element-id="HDKLTM4Z0QCSNSS6S617">Figure 9.13</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1619 rs_skip" id="HDKLTM4Z0QCSNSS6S617" clrenderdata="[&quot;UEYWFSDTKCB6P36VJ969&quot;]" id-sequence="599"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_f13-t2.png" data-width="395" data-height="425" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the effect of age on the process of gist recalling in children.

How do we reconcile these differences in retrieval for emotional events?</p> <p id="SYPX9FF4WLKEY5VR0034" id-sequence="612">As information moves through the stages described by the information processing model, it remains relatively fragile and subject to modification. Stress and strong negative emotions are accompanied by the release of hormones and by patterns of brain activity that can either enhance or impair memory processing, depending on the timing of the emotional response relative to target learning (Joëls, 2006). If stress and learning happen at the same time, an enhanced memory such as a flashbulb memory might be formed (<span class="citation" id="SENAZAGRW1B5W5841098" id-sequence="613">Diamond, Campbell, Park, Halonen, &amp; Zoladz, 2007</span>). Stress occurring either before or after learning impairs memory formation (Joëls, 2006). Impairment of memory following an important life event might protect the fragile memories of that event from interference until they are fully consolidated.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_342" data-page="342"></a> <p id="CDTDV5DHSBNDQGC8S735" id-sequence="614">So far, we have been considering isolated events that elicit strong negative emotions and stress.

Subsequently, these memories undergo a process of reconsolidation. If you are thinking about something you just read in the chapter, those memories are more “open” to modification, but memories for the more distant past are less changeable. What if we could get the brain to treat memories from the distant past more like recent memories?</p> <p id="GEZFAQFGPLX5A4MW1455" id-sequence="628">Long-term memories involve structural changes in neurons and their synapses that result from changes in gene expression, which we discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-chapter-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-element-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455">Chapter 3</a>. In mice, the state of a chemical called histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) correlates with the “open” period of reconsolidation in which memories are modifiable as opposed to the “closed” period characteristic of more remote memories (Gräff et al., 2014). Application of HDAC2 inhibitors essentially returns remote memories to the same modifiable state that characterizes fresh memories. Extinction of fear responses during this artificial reconsolidation state should produce more effective reductions in traumatic fear.</p> <p id="JRXKL4GJ8M3AB5ZCS859" id-sequence="629">We can’t imagine that anyone would wish continued suffering on people with PTSD, but not all therapists are comfortable with the concept of “erasing” traumatic memories.

Out of all cases in which an innocent person has been cleared of a crime because of DNA evidence, about 75% involved mistaken identification of the perpetrator by an eyewitness (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).</p> <p id="VVQGKESKN33PTHZYH539" id-sequence="640">Psychologists have used research on eyewitness behavior to make scientifically based recommendations to law enforcement officials. For example, the manner in which photograph lineups of possible suspects are shown to witnesses affects the likelihood of mistaken identification. In the typical procedure, witnesses view lineup photographs simultaneously, which allows them to compare all the people and choose the person who looks most similar to their memories of the perpetrator. Unfortunately, this procedure makes mistaken identification more likely if the real suspect does not appear in the lineup. The witness simply chooses the person who looks most like the remembered perpetrator. If a sequential procedure is used, in which the witness must respond “yes” or “no” to a picture before moving to the next one, mistaken identifications occur less frequently (<span class="citation" id="VNVL6AHHET92SBLS2438" id-sequence="641">Steblay, Dysart, Fulero, &amp; Lindsay, 2001</span>).</p> <p id="YCBAJ4SYYVM5P7HF1250" id-sequence="642">Perhaps juries could evaluate eyewitness testimony more accurately if they took the witness’s apparent confidence into account. In other words, a person who seems confident about identifying a suspect might be expected to be more accurate than a witness with less confidence. Unfortunately, witnesses testifying in court who express a 95% confidence in their judgment (expecting to be wrong only 5% of the time) are correct only 70% to 75% of the time (<span class="citation" id="XYUH18SBSGDR050X8798" id-sequence="643">Brewer, Keast, &amp; Rishworth, 2002</span>). However, witness confidence at the time of identification appears to be strongly related to accuracy (<span class="citation" id="HUQVFSTSHMW4VH7EH976" id-sequence="644">Wixted, Mickes, Clark, Gronlund, &amp; Roediger, 2015</span>). If courts paid more attention to this early confidence rather than confidence in the courtroom months or even years later, fewer innocent people should be convicted.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf161d rs_skip" id="DBPJCUH55NFQY7H90064" clrenderdata="[&quot;NTPS2RJPQF8WLP3DM508&quot;]" id-sequence="645"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf32-t2.jpg" data-width="311" data-height="451" data-alt="A photo shows a man working on a desktop, holding a photo of six people in a hand, and another hand on the mouse.

</span> as a decrease in the ability to remember a previously formed memory. The key here is that to forget a memory, it has to have been formed in the first place. This definition excludes a number of instances that we have discussed previously. For example, many students maintain that they “forgot” information needed for an exam but instead were daydreaming during the lecture covering the material and never learned it. This example is better understood in terms of lack of attention and encoding failure than as an example of forgetting. When forgetting is the result of brain injury or disease, we usually refer to the loss of information as amnesia.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_345" data-page="345"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1622 rs_skip" id="EKKHJ0TUGHAQLAH5X145" clrenderdata="[&quot;ULQZCZBM34VWHR183000&quot;]" id-sequence="725"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf38-t2.jpg" data-width="499" data-height="235" data-alt="If this woman was never able to forget where she parked all the previous times she used this lot, finding her car today would be extremely difficult."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="YSMKP898627E78RHZ300" id-sequence="726"><p>If this woman was never able to forget where she parked all the previous times she used this lot, finding her car today would be extremely difficult.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:499px;height:235px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_09_unf38-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="If this woman was never able to forget where she parked all the previous times she used this lot, finding her car today would be extremely difficult." width="499" height="235" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Andy Reynolds/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <p id="AFZVQQCYGUFJMU4WL272" id-sequence="727">Understanding forgetting is complicated because we measure memory indirectly by looking at performance. As most students are all too aware, actual memory for a topic can be quite different from performance on an exam. It would be handy for both students and instructors if some sort of modern imaging technology would allow us to “see” whether introductory psychology had been adequately stored in the brain, but alas, this is not currently possible. Stress, illness, time pressure, and distractions can temporarily reduce our ability to recall information. When we discuss true forgetting, we are not considering the effects of these temporary difficulties.</p> <p id="SRQCXXZZ0L6QVV7ZS591" id-sequence="728">Although forgetting can be frustrating, it also has its adaptive benefits. Forgetting provides a way to prioritize the things we should remember. For example, we are often asked to change our computer passwords to maintain security. At first, this can lead to annoying competition in memory between the old and the new passwords. Over time, however, the strength of an old password weakens. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that prefrontal areas of the brain actively suppress memories that are used less frequently (<span class="citation" id="AWNQ0AU2NV5TE25N4804" id-sequence="729">Kuhl, Dudukovic, Kahn, &amp; Wagner, 2007</span>). By suppressing these lower priority memories, we can avoid confusion and reduce the amount of work we have to do to recall higher priority memories.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="730"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="733"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="734" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="735" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="ADABL89U7DBM3ZVQ3870" id-sequence="736"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-6a</span> <span class="headingText">Decay</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="AKQUF8C352N2517TX670_content" id-sequence="737"> <p id="QBJC93GWWSYBB9DV2592" id-sequence="738"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1140" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1140"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1140" id="NFDX1E6DVRYERCNWU040" id-sequence="739"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Decay</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="FADH0ZE5JXAG8B0H9052" id-sequence="740">Decay</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A reduction in ability to retrieve rarely used information over time.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1140">

This method compares the rate of learning material the first time to the rate of learning the same material a second time. It might take you 50 practice trials to learn the periodic table of elements for your first chemistry class. In a subsequent course, you again need to memorize the table. This time, it only takes you 20 trials. The greater speed of learning the second time indicates that you retained or saved some prior memories of the table. Using this technique, we can demonstrate that people who studied high school Spanish but never used it later in life retained most of their memories for Spanish vocabulary words 50 years later (<span class="citation" id="TRXC0E1ST4AJGE28P262" id-sequence="742">Bahrick, 1984</span>). Instead of a large amount of forgetting because of the passage of time, most of the material we learn is retained nearly indefinitely.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1623 rs_skip" id="RNAU8HXT2EZ055GSQ513" clrenderdata="[&quot;JBELCWLFPBSU12XFK105&quot;]" id-sequence="743"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf39-t2.jpg" data-width="495" data-height="335" data-alt="People attending their 70th high school reunions might have forgotten the names of some of their classmates whom they hadn’t seen in decades."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="JFRFAN6FABMKB01H0837" id-sequence="744"><p>People attending their 70th high school reunions might have forgotten the names of some of their classmates whom they hadn’t seen in decades.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:495px;height:335px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_09_unf39-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="People attending their 70th high school reunions might have forgotten the names of some of their classmates whom they hadn’t seen in decades." width="495" height="335" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">ZUMA Press Inc/Alamy Stock Photo </div> </div></div></div> <p id="UMRZSN48SBS4HYZXG106" id-sequence="745">Although the idea of decay fits our everyday experience of forgetting quite well, most contemporary psychologists believe that the simple passage of time does not do a good job of predicting memories that are easy or difficult to retrieve (<span class="citation" id="QSDVKJ3K2AVEHNW1B267" id-sequence="746">Berman, 2009</span>).

</span> is the competition between newer and older information in the memory system. The brain requires a measurable amount of time to produce a physical representation of a memory. In the window of time in which memories are being processed but are not yet fully consolidated, they may be subject to distortion, loss, or replacement by interference from other bits of information.</p> <p id="PKLD0R1D9C235E5ZM376" id-sequence="758">How long is this window? The physical changes related to memory that occur at the level of the synapse might take minutes or hours. Memory loss usually occurs when this consolidation is interrupted. Individuals who experience unconsciousness as a result of a head injury rarely remember much about the immediate circumstances leading to the injury. Procedures such as general anesthesia or<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_346" data-page="346"></a> electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-element-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551">Chapter 15</a>, often produce slight memory deficits spanning a period of hours or possibly a day or two before and after treatment. In contrast, storage of memories in the cerebral cortex might take years, during which time information can be lost or distorted (<span class="citation" id="BNYANG5291QP015WA542" id-sequence="759">Dudai, 2004</span>).</p> <p id="RDRM7W2HSCHBLK7AP548" id-sequence="760">Interference can be demonstrated by comparing performance in a list-learning task. The more lists someone must learn, the more difficult it becomes to remember words on the first list (<span class="citation" id="SPUXZ144F70ADJQ7L112" id-sequence="761">Tulving &amp; Psotka, 1971</span>). In other words, learning new lists of words interfered with memory for the first list.</p> <p id="PGLECD5XNDD3YK3F6026" id-sequence="762">Does this mean that the first list is erased from memory by the incoming information? To test this hypothesis, researchers gave participants in one experiment a little help in the form of memory cues. The lists all contained categories of items, such as types of buildings (e.g., house, barn, garage, and hut). If the experimenters provided their participants with a cue in the form of the category (types of buildings), the effects of having learned additional lists were quite small. It appears that the words on the first list were maintained in memory, but learning additional lists made them hard to retrieve.</p> <p id="VABXFSYKKMHQU5W1B223" id-sequence="763">To make matters worse, interference can work in two directions (<span class="citation" id="JGTFQMWQG856HWJ9B043" id-sequence="764">Underwood, 1957</span>) (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TREY99YC0XUY5PBU4653" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="PUXUVSZ5EZLZMJVBJ220" data-element-id="TREY99YC0XUY5PBU4653">Figure 9.15</a>). Let’s assume that your foreign language class is assigned one list of vocabulary words to study each night. You have procrastinated on your homework, and to catch up for a quiz the next day, you now have three lists of vocabulary words to study instead of the usual single list. Our interest will be in how well you can remember the second of the three lists. If we compare your memories for the second list to those of students who studied the first list when it was assigned, we find that your performance is relatively poor.

</span>, or the failure to remember or retrieve unpleasant or threatening information, suggest that the nonsigners are protecting themselves from further unpleasantness by “forgetting” to sign their tax forms.</p> <p id="KRQGSC4RE1LNU7HCP052" id-sequence="784">Memory is a servant to our overarching goals. Retrieval, for better or worse, is often influenced by our motivations, and our motivations can distort the memories we retrieve. While not exactly forgetting in the sense of our earlier definition, motivated distortions of memory can be so extreme that the original information is essentially lost during the process.</p> <p id="JQVX2NSBYLSEGCHP0472" id-sequence="785">In one example of the influence of motivation on recall, study participants were presented with a list of choices, such as between two internships, roommates, or cars for sale, with equal numbers of corresponding positive and negative features (high resale value or<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_347" data-page="347"></a> some rust in the case of the cars). Subsequently, they remembered the positive features associated with their ultimate choices better than the negative features (<span class="citation" id="DGBKUM4UAAZX2HULV448" id-sequence="786">Henkel &amp; Mather, 2007</span>). When they were deceived into thinking they had chosen the other option instead (because of a friendly “reminder” from the experimenter), they continued to remember the false choice more positively. In related research, participants conveniently demonstrated less recall for ethical rules after they had been given an opportunity to cheat (<span class="citation" id="VPMVWS6PYX3HZLP66750" id-sequence="787">Shu, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2011</span>). In <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-element-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377">Chapter 13</a>, we will explore how these types of discrepancies between behavior and attitudes can change the attitudes, not just the memories for them.</p> <p id="JXYU2P52YACE6ZY4V986" id-sequence="788">Identifying the presence of motivated forgetting can have serious practical implications. Beginning in the 1970s, largely because of greater public recognition that incest was more common than previously believed, many adults began to report having been a victim of sexual abuse during childhood. These cases represented a range of possible motivated forgetting from suppression, in which the individual consciously remembered the incidents but had not reported them to parents or other authorities, to repression, in which the individual reported no conscious memory of the incidents until the memories were suddenly recovered during therapy or while reading a news report of a child molestation case.</p> <p id="AYPZK31FLMV3T0SM2809" id-sequence="789">A number of psychologists studying memory suspected that not all reports of recovered memories of child abuse were true, and some might represent confabulation or confusion between imagined and true memories. As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, our source monitoring abilities usually prevent us from mistaking false for true memories, but the system does not perform perfectly. Under the right set of circumstances, it is relatively easy for people to believe strongly in a memory that is simply not true.</p> <p id="KFFMHH7KJXW9FJ8SR998" id-sequence="790">We demonstrated in an earlier section on schemas that false recall for verbal stimuli can be produced by presenting words that are associated by meaningfulness (e.g., <em>bed, rest</em>, and <em>awake</em>). In this case, most study participants formed a false memory for the presentation of the word <em>sleep</em> (<span class="citation" id="EHJBMC7NUN3TXPACF711" id-sequence="791">Deese, 1959</span>). Perhaps you are thinking that memorizing strings of words in a laboratory has little relevance to the experience of traumatized victims of child abuse. Loftus, whom we met earlier in our discussion of memory reconstruction, addressed that concern by demonstrating that more complex false memories were rather easy to implant in study participants. <span class="citation" id="GUDABGGLY8DDUDSL3826" id-sequence="792"> Loftus (2003)</span> described how imagining an event had happened or even reading the testimonials of witnesses could increase a person’s confidence that a false event had occurred. Most persuasive is the use of photographs. When a real family photo was superimposed on a hot air balloon, 50% of participants “remembered” taking a ride, including details about how old they had been at the time and that the photo was taken by a particular person.</p> <p id="BTSKXKYWNTJBRZ1YL785" id-sequence="793">Until we understand more about the nature of confabulation, a cautious approach to repressed memories is probably the best course of action. We can neither prove nor disprove these memories without additional evidence, so any therapy should be aimed at relieving distressing symptoms without reference to their source (American Psychological Association, 2014).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="794"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="797"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="798" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="799" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="BVDLP9NCJ6EK55ZMM984" id-sequence="800"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-7</span> <span class="headingText">What Is the Biology of Memory?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="UXGGSTR8THY1QCJ1L250_content" id-sequence="801"> <p id="CCZXN118H2F96X1SU193" id-sequence="802">Cognitive neuroscientists have made considerable progress in discovering the biological correlates of memory processing.

</span>, which enhances communication between two neurons. This phenomenon can be demonstrated experimentally by applying a rapid series of electric pulses to one area of the nervous system and observing the increased reactions of cells receiving input from that area (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KQGM701TH7YC1ZC2K927" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="DNXU0LP3V0FU4NZJ0913" data-element-id="KQGM701TH7YC1ZC2K927">Figure 9.17</a>). Results from demonstrations of LTP suggest that the relatively simultaneous activation of a neuron sending information and the neuron receiving this information produces changes that make the synapse between them more efficient. LTP shares many features with memory, which makes it an attractive candidate for being one of the processes underlying memory phenomena. LTP lasts a long time, possibly indefinitely, which is similar to our thinking about long-term memories. Second, both memories and LTP can be formed after only brief exposure to stimuli.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1627 rs_skip" id="KQGM701TH7YC1ZC2K927" clrenderdata="[&quot;KMXK43LP81VYB24Q0791&quot;]" id-sequence="823"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_f17-t2.png" data-width="448" data-height="326" data-alt="Three images show the long-term potentiation.

Molaison retained most of his memory for events leading up to his surgery, but his ability to form new memories was profoundly reduced. The inability to form new memories is known as anterograde amnesia. Much to Milner’s surprise, Molaison learned a new procedural task, mirror tracing, as well as typical control participants did. In one of these tasks, Molaison was asked to draw the shape of a star while looking at a sample star and his hand in a mirror. After 3 days, Molaison mastered the task. However, if asked, he would deny ever having performed the task. His procedural memories were intact, but his declarative memories for the details of the task were nonexistent (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="LDMNM49S2C3XFU4DF225" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-section-id="PWRCGW91MHWCDGMF6311" data-element-id="LDMNM49S2C3XFU4DF225">Figure 9.18</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1628 rs_skip" id="LDMNM49S2C3XFU4DF225" clrenderdata="[&quot;WHBPJN1R521T2ER2S863&quot;]" id-sequence="855"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_09_f18-t3.png" data-width="705" data-height="509"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_f18-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="426" data-alt="An illustration with graphs shows that the declarative and nondeclarative memories are different.

Brenda Milner was surprised to observe that Henry Molaison learned the mirror-tracing task at a normal rate, even though he didn’t remember the details of the task.

The effects of state, mood, and context on retrieval suggest that studying in circumstances that are most similar to those in which you will retrieve your memories will give you the best outcome. In addition to these basic suggestions, we would like to offer a few additional tips.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="914"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="917"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="918" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="919" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="DSBH4ZU1PCH2C5QAK308" id-sequence="920"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">9-8a</span> <span class="headingText">Distribute Practice over Time</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="SQMP326AA6W04JR4B722_content" id-sequence="921"> <p id="RZCZ52GZUT7EM7K63911" id-sequence="922">Psychology professors will never give up trying to convince students that cramming is a terrible memory strategy.

Retrieval practice appears to buffer performance from stress effects much better than restudying. It is likely that retrieval practice accomplishes this feat by producing multiple routes for accessing a memory. Each time you attempt to retrieve information, you also think about associations and the context of the information in slightly different ways. This provides you with multiple pathways back to the information you seek.

The first-letter approach takes advantage of chunking. You condense a large amount of information into an acronym.

This technique is particularly handy when you are trying to memorize a list of items in order, such as the planets in our solar system or the cranial nerves. The method takes advantage of the fact that we form excellent representations of visual images in memory. You begin by imagining a familiar place, perhaps your childhood home. As you imagine yourself walking through your home, you visualize each item in a particular location. If you wish to remember your grocery list (although writing the items down is probably easier), you might imagine a carton of eggs on the little table in your entry, a loaf of bread on the sofa, a box of cereal on the television, and so on. To recall your list, all you need to do is to take another imaginary walk through your house, recalling the items you placed as you go.

One of the authors of this textbook had a colleague in graduate school who performed so perfectly on her neuroanatomy exams that her professors accused her of cheating. She related to them how she had been taught the method of loci as a childhood game and had practiced the technique throughout her academic career. After they posed several difficult lists to her, all of which she recalled perfectly, they were convinced of her honesty.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf162f rs_skip" id="XZYHKCF7T41YH5SXG443" clrenderdata="[&quot;FXGF2KEB6NMM8T04Q831&quot;]" id-sequence="1015"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf44-t2.jpg" data-width="454" data-height="293" data-alt="A photo shows a man examining an onion in the vegetables section."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="TNQDV2PLBUVT26CB3193" id-sequence="1016"><p>The ancient Greek mnemonic device, the method of loci, takes advantage of our superior memory for visual images of familiar places.

You may know people in close relationships who seem to know intuitively what the other is thinking, perhaps even finishing the partner’s sentences. According to a theory of transactive memory, couples in long-term relationships also develop a division of labor in regard to memory, in which each partner knows certain things but also knows what information can be retrieved from the partner if needed (<span class="citation" id="MLPRL1CG7UZSWX5VX732" id-sequence="1024">Wegner, 1986</span>; <span class="citation" id="AUHYFULCL51ADLUS9116" id-sequence="1025"> Wegner, Giuliano, &amp; Hertel, 1985</span>). For example, one partner might not keep track of where candles are stored in the house but knows that the other partner knows where the candles are and can be called upon to provide that knowledge in the event of an emergency.</p> <p id="SPHMKNJJUCEYC5ZBD264" id-sequence="1026">How do couples develop systems like this? Three major strategies have been identified (<span class="citation" id="CYHH2C2CFX7D78DFB530" id-sequence="1027">Wegner, Erber, &amp; Raymond, 1991</span>). First, one partner can explicitly agree to take on an area of expertise, such as managing the household finances. Second, as people get to know each other better through self-disclosure, they also learn about each other’s relative areas of knowledge and expertise. One partner might have an interest in computer science, while the other thinks that computers work by magic. If something goes wrong with a household computer, the second person will turn to the first. Finally, couples learn about their partner’s access to information. If you know that your partner discussed holiday plans with your families, you are likely to assume that your partner knows more about your holiday options than you do.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1630 rs_skip" id="CFNW7XNLXF41VLEH0273" clrenderdata="[&quot;TPYECWKRQ9V6TSS5L583&quot;]" id-sequence="1028"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_09_unf45-t2.jpg" data-width="418" data-height="269" data-alt="People in close relationships form transactive memories, or a division of labor for remembering certain things.

One major advantage of this type of transactive memory is that a couple working well together has access to far more knowledge than either individual could manage separately. The convenience of these systems, in contrast to managing knowledge individually, would contribute to further bonding. Transactive memory is negotiated over long periods between each couple in ways that are unique and not interchangeable with others.</p> <p id="CHUNX5AW7VNR2X5H4131" id-sequence="1031">The concept of transactive memory has been extended from intimate couples to larger groups (<span class="citation" id="NWBNTZ5EFPW77GW8T252" id-sequence="1032">Peltokorpi, 2008</span>). In the context of larger groups, transactive memory contributes to group cognition or information processing that differs from individual cognition. Transactive memory is critical to understanding the behavior of teams in organizations (<span class="citation" id="AZJXMGGLGHGC2E962108" id-sequence="1033">Argote &amp; Guo, 2016</span>; <span class="citation" id="JXUVS0XTL7S2JEM5M327" id-sequence="1034"> Lee, Bachrach, &amp; Lewis, 2014</span>). As in the case of intimate couples, transactive memory contributes to the group’s ability to manage more information than any individual could be expected to do in an efficient manner based on the relevant specialties of the individuals making up the group. Transactive memory contributes to the establishment, maintenance, and adaptation of organizational routines, or ways to solve familiar problems (<span class="citation" id="JLWN6ALDTLD3LU7FG743" id-sequence="1035">Miller, Choi, &amp; Pentland, 2014</span>).</p> <p id="VZHG62BJPFBWCMFGF732" id-sequence="1036">Whether transactive memory takes place at the couple or the organizational level, it takes time to develop.

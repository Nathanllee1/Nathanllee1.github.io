Other research shows that the brain can be manipulated to make an unusual choice without disrupting the individual’s sense of free will. Right-handed people normally use their right hand 60% of the time or more when forced to choose to use one hand over the other, but when researchers exposed right-handed subjects’ right hemispheres to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), illustrated in the large image on the previous page, they chose to use their left hand 80% of the time (<span class="citation" id="FXXGVFVA8HT74E0NJ603" id-sequence="35">Ammon &amp; Gandevia, 1990</span>). Despite making the uncharacteristic choice to use “the wrong hand,” the participants in this experiment reported feeling in control of their hand movements. If the brain has already committed to a movement, what purpose does a conscious sense of having decided to move serve?<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_193" data-page="193"></a> Insight into this question emerged from the study of split-brain patients described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>. These patients have undergone surgery that severs the connections between their right and their left hemispheres, making it possible to expose one hemisphere at a time to a stimulus. For example, you can show the relatively nonverbal right hemisphere the word <em>stand</em>, and the patient usually stands up. However, because of the limitations of the right hemisphere in processing language, the patient is consciously unaware of having read the word. When asked why they stood up, patients responded by saying they felt the need to stretch. In other words, the mind is building a theory about the behavior that was just performed (Gazzaniga, 2012). This type of observation leads to a view of consciousness as an interpreter, making sense out of our actions and the world within and around us. This view helps us understand the observed delay between the brain’s commitment to an action and our conscious awareness of that decision—the interpreter needs time to analyze the situation.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf151e rs_skip" id="HDSQAUZC8HTLJGQEP321" clrenderdata="[&quot;WYZSXPMPR5JJT5C8M282&quot;]" id-sequence="36"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="512" data-height="330" data-alt="Social context plays a role in sleep, even for the fruit fly.

We understand that to be unconscious, perhaps because of a blow to the head, means that we are unaware of what is happening within and around us. However, the term <em>consciousness</em> has multiple meanings. Consciousness can refer to a state of awareness (alert versus drowsy, for example) or the current content of awareness (while reading this page, you hear your neighbor’s music).

William James (1899, p. 15) coined the term “stream of consciousness” to capture the moving, seemingly unbroken flow of conscious awareness. Sigmund Freud used the term <em>consciousness</em> to refer to aspects of the mind that could be retrieved voluntarily, in contrast to the unconscious parts of the mind that remain hidden to voluntary searches for information. Contemporary cognitive psychologists debate why some information becomes conscious while other information does not (<span class="citation" id="RDUNQ0NFF9K6EYX34758" id-sequence="54">Baars, 1988</span>).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="55"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="58"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="59" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="60" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="QCFTYLFAMQW73GZBN617" id-sequence="61"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">6-1a</span> <span class="headingText">The Evolution of Consciousness</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="KMSYXDV606V5WJJNM226_content" id-sequence="62"> <p id="CBKFQM2GL3AZCD5KS115" id-sequence="63">Most of us would agree that bacteria do not possess consciousness, but people do. This implies that consciousness emerged at some point in the course of evolution. The exact location of that point remains highly debatable. James (1890, p. 141) maintained that “consciousness grows the more complex and intense the higher we rise in the animal kingdom. That of a man must exceed that of an oyster.” If consciousness evolved as suggested by James, what advantages might account for this development?</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_194" data-page="194"></a> <p id="HLTK4L8BKQPNLUVWW964" id-sequence="64">The question of the emergence of consciousness in animals is complicated by the multiple meanings of <em>consciousness</em> described previously. Most animals show variations in states of awareness. Even the humble fruit fly takes periods of rest, which are believed to be the fruit fly equivalent of sleep (<span class="citation" id="SRLY6N3UT4U6KE7VS743" id-sequence="65">Shaw, Cirelli, Greenspan, &amp; Tononi, 2000</span>). Consciousness defined as an awareness of ongoing sensations is probably less common in the animal kingdom. Many animals would survive quite well by simply responding automatically to the world around them (“food” or “predator”) without necessarily thinking “I smell food” or “I see a predator.” The self-awareness aspect of consciousness—as exemplified in “I” statements—might be the rarest of all among living things, as we will see later.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="WUTRSEJFAK9NWYX6A567" id-sequence="66"> <h3 id="KGXH2QAFN2EUA14F0022" id-sequence="67"><span class="headingText">Consciousness as Variations in Alertness</span></h3> <p id="STDWWRNC98F49PG1J509" id-sequence="68">Varying states of awareness might allow animals to repair their bodies and conserve energy. Food requirements would be higher if we stayed awake for 24 hours, as you may have noticed while studying for final exams. Another possible benefit of varying states of awareness is maximizing safety. Most animals are specialized for activity in either the light or the dark. Sleeping during the cycle for which an animal is poorly equipped for activity might contribute to its survival.

Before the age of about 18 months, children do not seem to indicate that they understand the image in the mirror is their own.

Neuroscientists initially believed that when your thought is unfocused during a state known as <em>mind wandering</em>, the brain would be quiet, but as you focus on a specific task, the brain would “light up.” This does not seem to be the case.

As much as 30 seconds before a mistake occurred, the DMN would take over, and activity in areas involved with focused attention decreased.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1525 rs_skip" id="EZRZS2Q8MHLG3RRYY194" clrenderdata="[&quot;WDBQ1ZEF77LCYYV12694&quot;]" id-sequence="128"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_06_f02-t3.png" data-width="704" data-height="301"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_f02-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="249" data-alt="An illustration shows two images of brain, one of the inside right hemisphere, and another of the outside left hemisphere.

Many people fall somewhere between these two extremes and are at their best in the middle of the day.

During beta activity, a person is actively thinking and alert. Beta activity is characterized by rapid (15 to 30 cycles per second), irregular, low-amplitude waves that indicate the cerebral cortex is processing large amounts of diverse data. A person showing alpha activity is awake but relaxed. Alpha waves are slightly slower, larger, and more regular than beta waves, with a frequency of 9 to 12 cycles per second.

Even if you have not done some of these things recently, try to work out how they would have affected you. Use the scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation. A score greater than 10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness. If you scored at this level or above, it’s time for some lifestyle changes.</p> </div></div> <p id="JSZU07MR7R3V5GH0T096" id-sequence="323">The first episode of REM sleep occurs between 90 and 120 minutes after the onset of sleep. This stage is often called paradoxical sleep, reflecting a combination of brain activity resembling waking with the external appearance of deep sleep. During REM sleep, the EEG shows activity similar to waking activity. The eyes make the periodic movements back and forth that give this stage its name. The sympathetic nervous system becomes very active. Heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing become rapid or irregular. Males experience erections, while females experience increased blood flow in the vicinity of the vagina (Hirshkowitz &amp; Moore, 1996). If awakened during this stage, most people report vivid, storylike dreams, which we discuss in more detail in a later section.</p> <p id="YXRH25PW5NTWS3DN8483" id-sequence="324">Major postural muscles are inactive during REM sleep, effectively paralyzing the sleeper, although smaller muscles in the fingers and the toes might twitch. You might have experienced dreams in which something terrible was coming, but you couldn’t move. Your dream probably reflects recognition on the part of the brain that you are paralyzed. This paralysis provides a protective mechanism that prevents you from acting out your dreams. In cases of REM sleep behavior disorder, paralysis fails, and people injure themselves or their sleeping partners. When one patient dreamed of playing football, he knocked everything off his dresser, hit his head against the wall, and banged his knee on the dresser (<span class="citation" id="RPXFLPZP1PT0JNMFW848" id-sequence="325">Schenck, Bundlie, Ettinger, &amp; Mohowald, 2002</span>).</p> <p id="LBAD3EURE5TM2X95L613" id-sequence="326">Because the body is paralyzed during REM sleep, sleepwalking cannot happen in this stage. Instead, sleepwalking occurs when a person is in stage 3 or 4 of N-REM sleep. Sleep talking is most common during lighter stages of N-REM sleep, but it is also possible during REM sleep. These phenomena become progressively less common with age.</p> <p id="CXMRF68TRDXXQNHHX437" id-sequence="327">The cycling between REM sleep and N-REM sleep in humans follows a characteristic pattern over a period of 8 hours of sleep (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="WZBC542NMLWPTHE2D682" data-chapter-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-section-id="NSFR7AFRHPBQJKP60358" data-element-id="WZBC542NMLWPTHE2D682">Figure 6.8</a>). The first half of a night’s sleep is characterized by longer periods of N-REM sleep and brief periods of REM sleep. Stages 3 and 4 of<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_205" data-page="205"></a> N-REM sleep are especially dominant during these first 4 hours. The second half of the night’s sleep switches to a different pattern. REM sleep is now dominant, and N-REM sleep remains in the lighter stages. Stages 3 and 4 may be infrequent or absent during the last 4 hours of sleep. We usually spend the last half hour or so of the night’s sleep in REM sleep and often wake up with the awareness that we have been dreaming.</p> <div class="container dependent narrative  rs_skip"

In 2014, a commuter train at Chicago’s O’Hare airport controlled by an operator who admitted to dozing off ran off the tracks and climbed an escalator.

Nearly all human growth hormone, which plays important roles in repairing the body, is released during stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep but rarely during other stages of sleep and waking (Savine &amp; Sönksen, 2000) (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ECLRAMPYV4TQGS5W6318" data-chapter-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-section-id="NSFR7AFRHPBQJKP60358" data-element-id="ECLRAMPYV4TQGS5W6318">Figure 6.9</a>).

When volunteers are specifically deprived of REM sleep, they show many of the same symptoms as people who experience an overall lack of sleep, including irritability and difficulty concentrating. In addition, REM sleep-deprived individuals show a phenomenon known as REM rebound (<span class="citation" id="PMSJFPH6ZVZWDM1LR961" id-sequence="408">Dement, 1960</span>). When allowed to sleep normally, they spend an unusually large amount of their sleep time in REM sleep. You may have experienced REM rebound during a nap following a night with little sleep.

Without treatment, they enter REM sleep earlier in the night than typical participants do, and they spend a greater proportion of their sleeping time in REM sleep. One of the possible mechanisms by which antidepressant medications regulate mood is their suppression of REM sleep. Individuals with bipolar disorder, which is characterized by moods that swing from euphoria to depression, experience an abnormally low need for sleep.</p> <p id="QGSDPSHUVTCY6KVR7443" id-sequence="417">These correlations between REM sleep and mood may represent a common underlying biochemical mechanism. Brainstem neurons that release serotonin and norepinephrine are especially quiet during REM sleep, although they are active during waking and somewhat active during N-REM sleep (<span class="citation" id="ZSKRYKTP4R47J0KXE352" id-sequence="418">Gottesman, 2002</span>).

Rather than proposing sharp distinctions between dreaming during sleep and other types of thought, dream activity is seen as being on a continuum extending across focused thought and mind wandering during wakefulness to thought-like and dream-like behaviors during sleep.</p> <p id="EBLFXBXXP3P20J5HW584" id-sequence="428">An activation–synthesis theory of dreaming suggests that the content of dreams simply reflects ongoing neural activity. For example, dreams of being unable to move in a dangerous situation might accurately mirror the muscle paralysis present during the REM state (<span class="citation" id="JFJZGUR11WDRN07ER281" id-sequence="429">Hobson &amp; McCarley, 1977</span>). Common dreams of flying or falling may be caused by the unusual activation of the vestibular system during REM sleep (<span class="citation" id="VVYAZDBJCY048VTW8083" id-sequence="430">Hunt, 1989</span>). In <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-chapter-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-element-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599">Chapter 5</a>, we discussed the vestibular system’s role in helping us maintain balance. Dreams with sexual content are consistent with the physical sexual arousal that occurs during REM sleep. Combining results of brain imaging experiments and cognitive psychology leads to yet another view of dreams. Dreaming behavior correlates with activity in circuits that overlap substantially with the DMN (<span class="citation" id="ESKPS91H5MFWTPJRK774" id-sequence="431">Fox, Nijeboer, Solomonova, Domhoff, &amp; Christoff, 2013</span>). According to this view, daydreaming<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_208" data-page="208"></a> and dreaming during sleep are on a continuum. Simultaneous changes in brainstem activity result in lower sensitivity to outside stimuli, and reduced overall frontal lobe activity might lead to less self-awareness and logical thought than occurs during daydreaming. Once the dream state is initiated, the brain draws on memories of general knowledge and personal experience to produce a story line (<span class="citation" id="NLPPNDP5LUGKG2ATZ923" id-sequence="432">Foulkes, 1999</span>).</p> <div class="container dependent mt_connectingtoresearch narrative  rs_skip" id="YYCUD9GYBBQSA6F89251" label="connectingtoresearch" id-sequence="433"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Connecting to Research </span><h3 id="GVQZN039NVS0RVBDZ750" id-sequence="434">Loneliness Affects Sleep</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="YYCUD9GYBBQSA6F89251_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="435"> <p id="ENVY0URHX6JX3N28V487" id-sequence="436">Most of us are aware that mood and stress can have negative impacts on our sleep, but it might surprise you that loneliness can be a problem for good sleep quality too.

You might think that loneliness affects people by making them less likely to follow good health habits, such as taking their medication and exercising, but research didn’t support this hypothesis.

First, it is possible that the experience of loneliness causes poor sleep quality. Second, poor sleep quality could interfere with a person’s ability to function well socially, leading to loneliness. Third, loneliness and sleep quality could influence each other reciprocally. Finally, some third variable or set of variables could lead to both disruptions of feeling socially connected and sleep quality. If you think that a likely candidate for one of these third variables is depression, the researchers controlled for this by assessing depression before the study and excluding potential participants who appeared to be depressed. In addition, these various interpretations were tested in a subsequent longitudinal study. Loneliness was found to decrease sleep quality, and neither sleep quality nor any third variable that was tested (e.g., depressive symptoms) was found to influence loneliness (see review by <span class="citation" id="LRRBP5J33BLXCBNKY452" id-sequence="454"> Cacioppo et al., 2015</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1534 rs_skip" id="WXLUBMEYR2H26C5LJ440" clrenderdata="[&quot;KAJATCF5S58E7A53Y341&quot;]" id-sequence="455"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf15-t2.jpg" data-width="346" data-height="270" data-alt="A photo shows a woman sleeping in a bed having two wires attached to a band on her forehead.

In sleep terrors, the usually smooth transition from stage 4 N-REM sleep upward into REM sleep goes awry. The sleeper becomes acutely distressed despite remaining deeply asleep. If awakened, the person shows the disorientation and confusion typically demonstrated when a sleeper is disturbed during deep N-REM sleep. There is usually no memory of the sleep terror the next day. Twin studies suggest that there is a genetic predisposition to sleep terrors (<span class="citation" id="HAYHW4MMM6UV4YS0V306" id-sequence="479">Taheri &amp; Mignot, 2002</span>).</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="JQCQNC15G3ZYCJVJE270" id-sequence="480"> <h3 id="JGCJ0M5SFAYXFKC86301" id-sequence="481"><span class="headingText">Insomnia</span></h3> <p id="CLKM6NS4HLJ243CVQ612" id-sequence="482">After nightmares, the most common sleep problem is <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1003" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1003"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1003" id="PYYZW14CTULTQBZ5K117" id-sequence="483"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">insomnia</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="JQPKWTM0418TKM05E331" id-sequence="484">insomnia</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A sleep disorder characterized by an inability to either initiate or maintain normal sleep.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1003">

Although most people seem to need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night to function effectively, wider healthy variations exist. In one case of “healthy insomnia,” an elderly woman slept only 1 hour per night without apparent detrimental effects (<span class="citation" id="ETPKQ1GNZ2Q86FWJ6437" id-sequence="485">Meddis, Pearson, &amp; Langford, 1973</span>).</p> <p id="KPTYVW07NRCXFBSFV449" id-sequence="486">Insomnia occurs in one of two forms. In cases of onset insomnia, a person lies in bed for what seems to be a long period but is unable to go to sleep. Stress and anxiety are frequent causes of this type of insomnia. Maintenance insomnia occurs when sleep is frequently interrupted or early waking occurs. These cases typically result from stress, substance use, or psychological disorders. Insomnia medications, such as zolpidem (Ambien), have minor effects on sleep, producing sleep 15 minutes faster and lengthening it for about 30 minutes, which might not offset significant side effects, including dependence on the medication, driving or walking while asleep, memory loss, and loss of coordination (<span class="citation" id="GZBY8ZJZ2UUEXR7GQ551" id-sequence="487">Buscemi et al., 2007</span>).</p> <p id="UALT1J10YLNCBKWV7438" id-sequence="488">Because light can interfere with the sleep hormone melatonin, the use of tablets and smartphones right before bed can interfere with sleep quality.

</span>. Narcolepsy consists of “sleep attacks,” in which REM sleep occurs during wakefulness (<span class="citation" id="KDVFJXH55YJH415M5562" id-sequence="494">Dahl, Holttum, &amp; Trubnick, 1994</span>). In addition to sleep attacks, other aspects of REM sleep may intrude into the wakefulness of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy occurs when the muscle paralysis normally associated with REM sleep occurs during wakefulness without loss of consciousness. Many patients with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis or muscle paralysis that either precedes actual sleep or lingers once the person has awakened. Although upsetting, this paralysis is easy to resolve. Simply touching the person is enough to end the paralysis.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1536 rs_skip" id="CGAAKYJD0Z0PH7Z4B442" clrenderdata="[&quot;KWXANCVQ02E1W9NS4746&quot;]" id-sequence="495"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf16-t2.png" data-width="233" data-height="167" data-alt="A scan of a human brain shows purple color towards the sides in the top, with yellow in between.

</span>. In a person with sleep apnea, breathing can stop for a minute or two, and the sleeper awakens abruptly gasping for air. Not only does this lack of air disrupt the sleep quality of the person with sleep apnea, but it can increase the risk for heart disease (<span class="citation" id="SZLWP4UTAZAHMQGAL558" id-sequence="507">Kendzerska, Gershon, Hawker, Leung, &amp; Tomlinson, 2014</span>). Because most cases of sleep apnea occur in people who are obese and who snore (obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea), losing weight and surgical correction of airway blockages are common treatments. Other cases occur when brainstem neurons responsible for maintaining breathing during sleep malfunction (central sleep apnea). In these cases, the use of a machine that regulates airflow during sleep is an inconvenient but effective solution.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="BFSVV3RRK6MD2ZD5K224" id-sequence="508"> <h3 id="LXLXZXXULXQ72DPHM669" id-sequence="509"><span class="headingText">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</span></h3> <p id="EEXYB4XXVJG4VZYTY808" id-sequence="510"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1006" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1006"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1006" id="USWZ5PCBKWHNKB0EM474" id-sequence="511"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="URFQBFDQDF74NEJDW326" id-sequence="512">Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A sleep disorder in which an otherwise healthy infant dies while asleep</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1006">

In certain tragic instances, patients with Capgras even try to harm the “imposters.” Capgras syndrome and prosopagnosia produce opposite effects. In Capgras syndrome, the ability to recognize faces remains intact, but the sense of emotion and familiarity is distorted. The damage associated with Capgras syndrome is not thoroughly understood, but it probably involves connections between visual areas of the brain and the amygdala (<span class="citation" id="GBBRB9CXG83VJZ9XK370" id-sequence="659">Ramachandran, 1998</span>).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="660"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="663"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="664" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="665" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="JAKZ91F4EUGPSJMG8779" id-sequence="666"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">6-3b</span> <span class="headingText">Coma, Vegetative State, Brain Death, and Near-Death</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="SHWBNYT5XTTSGZ4HA711_content" id-sequence="667"> <p id="DASCG1Z5YKYAM0JNJ914" id-sequence="668">Consciousness is altered not only by damage in particular areas of the brain but by the severity of damage as well.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="NTGQ747J3WF2JJKKX994" id-sequence="669"> <h3 id="JQVZ2KTW7A3L4NBDJ084" id-sequence="670"><span class="headingText">Coma</span></h3> <p id="NVCG223Z8DVDPEK4E147" id-sequence="671">Our word coma comes from the Greek word for “deep sleep.” Coma produces a profound state of unconsciousness in which the person does not have sleep–wake cycles, cannot be awakened, does not respond to pain or light, and is incapable of voluntary behavior.

People with recurring seizures are diagnosed with epilepsy. Seizures occur as a result of brain injury or infection but can also appear without an obvious cause. Disturbances in the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA might account for many seizures.

Consciousness is lost in generalized seizures. The two major categories of generalized seizure are tonic-clonic and absence seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures begin with a loss of consciousness, cessation of breathing, and intense muscular contraction. This phase usually gives way to violent, rhythmic contractions that may result in broken bones or other physical injuries. These phases are followed by a period of coma, lasting about 5 minutes.

</span> is a compulsive physical or psychological dependence on a substance or activity that continues in spite of negative consequences. Although tolerance and withdrawal are two hallmark symptoms of physical dependence on a drug, not all addictive drugs display these features. For example, cocaine is quite addictive despite its lack of withdrawal symptoms. The defining features of an addiction are the compulsive repetition of drug use or an activity and the inability to abstain from the addictive behavior despite serious negative consequences. Addiction overwhelms normal control of behavior, distorts typical systems of reward, and interferes with the recognition of problems.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1546 rs_skip" id="QPBEB0PZ6R2Q0R35Z510" clrenderdata="[&quot;WLPRMUZD72MELQEEK800&quot;]" id-sequence="756"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf28-t2.jpg" data-width="298" data-height="429" data-alt="A photo shows a solider walking past the heroin crop growing in abundance while walking."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="TYZTJ50S9U1CQN2NA301" id-sequence="757"><p>Should we be concerned about military veterans returning from service in Afghanistan with opium addictions?

When used in religious contexts, hallucinogens are often referred to as entheogens, loosely translated as “generating the divine within.” In South America, people were using a brew known as ayahuasca centuries ago as part of their religious rituals, but the practice has since spread globally. Ayahuasca contains the hallucinogen N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which like most hallucinogens is chemically very similar to serotonin. DMT, which occurs naturally in small amounts in the brain, produces vivid visual hallucinations and euphoria but also intense vomiting. In contrast to the acceptance of ayahuasca in South America, DMT use is illegal in most countries. However, legal exceptions have been made for use of ayahuasca in religious settings. In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to allow ayahuasca churches to continue to use tea during their ceremonies.</p> <p id="MMSXAC05EGAYF1YX8908" id-sequence="820">A popular interest in ayahuasca has led to the development of ayahuasca retreats in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil.

Both drugs distort the action of dopamine transporters, gates that move previously released dopamine back into the presynaptic cell (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>), but they do so differently. Methamphetamine mimics dopamine, leading it to be moved out of the synaptic gap into neurons by dopamine transporters. Once inside the neuron, methamphetamine enters synaptic vesicles, pushing the dopamine molecules out into the intracellular fluid of the axon terminal. The presence of large amounts of dopamine outside of vesicles makes the transporters begin to work in reverse, pushing dopamine out of the cell. With the transporters working in reverse and unable to retrieve the released dopamine, the molecules of dopamine become trapped in the synaptic gap, stimulating receptors continuously. Cocaine’s action on the dopamine transporters is simpler. Cocaine simply blocks the transporters, keeping all previously released dopamine active in the synaptic gap.

MDMA increases sociability by stimulating the activity of serotonin and oxytocin (Thompson, Callaghan, Hunt, Cornish, &amp; McGregor, 2007). MDMA mimics serotonin and is actually taken up more readily than serotonin itself by serotonin transporters. Once inside the cell, MDMA interferes with the storage of serotonin in vesicles and causes the transporters to begin acting in reverse, resulting in the release of large amounts of serotonin. Serotonin becomes trapped in the synaptic gap by the malfunctioning transporters, allowing it to continue to interact with receptors. Side effects of MDMA can include dehydration, exhaustion, hyperthermia (high core body temperature), convulsions, and death (<span class="citation" id="LTHQBM6NLXGHG1L7F290" id-sequence="851">Pilgrim, Gerostamoulos, &amp; Drummer, 2011</span>).

It reduces anxiety, which makes relatively shy people more outgoing at a party.

At very high doses, alcohol can produce coma and death, either from suppression of breathing or aspiration of vomit.</p> <p id="YBBHTRF50EJFVW4BE699" id-sequence="864">Alcohol produces its main behavioral effects by boosting the effects of GABA, the main inhibitory neurochemical in the brain. By boosting an inhibitor, alcohol depresses the activity of the brain, particularly that of the cerebral cortex.

Opioids that are derived from the opium poppy are known as opiates. The opium poppy is the source of several psychoactive opiates, including morphine and codeine. Heroin can be synthesized through further processing of morphine. These substances are effective because they imitate the action of endorphins (short for endogenous morphine). Neurons possessing endorphin receptors are located in parts of the brain involved with pain, stress, and attachment. The activity of both natural endorphins and opioids results in the release of large amounts of dopamine, leading to feelings of well-being and reduction of pain.</p> <p id="GRVTZ53CA87HCS2KW597" id-sequence="868">Opioids have legitimate medical purposes, including pain control, cough suppression, and control of diarrhea. At low doses typical in medical practice, opioids produce a sense of euphoria, pain relief, reduced anxiety, muscle relaxation, and sleep. The higher doses characteristic of opioid abuse affect consciousness by producing a strong, rapid onset feeling of euphoria, or a “rush.” With even higher doses, opioids exert a strong depression on breathing, occasionally leading to death.</p> <p id="PRGHRL7E0TLZH0RB4783" id-sequence="869">Among the current frequently abused forms of opioids is the relatively new painkiller oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), reportedly used by more than 8% of recent 12th graders (Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2011).

Nearly everyone who can read shows a robust Stroop effect, and extensive training does not make the effect go away. This effect is typically explained in terms of a well-practiced skill (reading) taking precedence over a less practiced skill (naming the colors of letters).

</span> techniques vary widely and may occur in either religious or nonreligious contexts. When experienced practitioners are asked to describe the subjective experience produced by meditation, they describe a conscious state without thought, accompanied by a blissful emotional state (<span class="citation" id="TFVKQLB7SE01U4P33815" id-sequence="907">Travis, 2001</span>). A variation on meditation known as mindfulness meditation has been used more frequently over recent years to treat substance abuse and a variety of psychological disorders (Hölzel et al., 2011). Mindfulness refers to “nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment” (Hölzel et al., 2011, p. 537). Meditation incorporating mindfulness also appears to produce benefits in immune function, blood pressure, stress hormone levels, and cognitive functioning.</p> <p id="WFTTLTUVMJUGEAHTY657" id-sequence="908">EEG recordings during meditation feature increased proportions of alpha waves, which we described earlier as being characteristic of an awake but relaxed state. In participants who had meditated more than 3 years, increased theta activity, normally found in lighter stages of sleep, was observed over the frontal lobes of the brain (<span class="citation" id="USQWCDCZ81J16RADW930" id-sequence="909">Aftanas &amp; Golocheikine, 2001</span>). Theta activity in the prefrontal areas of the brain has been correlated with positive emotions (<span class="citation" id="GDRA50LGDS1PKR1SE906" id-sequence="910">Aftanas, Varlamov, Pavlov, Makhnev, &amp; Reva, 2001</span>).</p> <p id="MCTAEGPJGBC7HMMKL845" id-sequence="911">Imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggest that meditation represents a voluntary regulation of attention and autonomic functions (<span class="citation" id="EBFUGYNBN5PNWK3VR351" id-sequence="912">Lazar et al., 2000</span>). Brain imaging studies have discovered that experienced meditators showed less activity in the brain’s DMN, which was described earlier in this chapter (<span class="citation" id="DMQRMUQRBVSKMLV1P073" id-sequence="913">Brewer et al., 2011</span>). As we noted previously, activity in the DMN is usually correlated not only with mind wandering and thinking about the self but also with unhappiness.

Among the unconscious behaviors that have been identified by psychologists is one that is particularly relevant to relationships—the effect of mimicry on liking and feeling close to others (<span class="citation" id="CGMZ1BWT8BT192WF0941" id-sequence="938">Lakin, Chartrand, &amp; Arkin, 2008</span>). A substantial body of research supports the idea that we unconsciously copy the behavior of others and that when we do copy another person’s behavior, that person likes us better without necessarily knowing why.</p> <p id="CEMTUDJ0EDYFD9SKF256" id-sequence="939">Under what circumstances are we most likely to copy the behavior of other people? One possible answer is that we mimic others to avoid or repair social exclusion. Jessica Lakin and her colleagues (2008) made their participants feel socially excluded (temporarily) and then observed that these excluded participants were more likely to mimic another person than were participants who had not been socially excluded. This process extends to group membership as well. Participants excluded by an in-group were subsequently more likely to mimic an in-group member than an out-group member. These results suggest that mimicry developed as an automatic behavior that we could use to respond to threats to our social connectivity, which as we have stated many times previously, could have been a matter of life or death to our hunter–gatherer ancestors.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1556 rs_skip" id="GJER9EZBE3P7BNBRZ076" clrenderdata="[&quot;JBLXGZ1CXU2VV410R326&quot;]" id-sequence="940"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf34-t2.jpg" data-width="325" data-height="209" data-alt="A photo shows a man and a boy sitting on a couch and cheering while the man is holding a baseball in his hand."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="NACKZ0E0GXDM9PXW1926" id-sequence="941"><p>We often imitate the behavior of others without being consciously aware that we’re doing so.

Knowing now that this is an adaptive behavior, look more closely at how you behave when encountering situations in which you feel excluded. It could be a social situation, such as at a party or an organizational event, where you are trying to mingle or initiate a dialogue with others. Or perhaps you observe mimicry when you are around someone you like romantically. Do you feign interest in things you wouldn’t necessarily be interested in otherwise? Are you more apt to align yourself with the personality of the person you find interesting? Do you see this kind of behavior in friends or family?</p> </div></div> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_227" data-page="227"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologytakesonrealworldproblems narrative  rs_skip" id="TXYT2MYVFMQ8N0WLF725" label="psychologytakesonrealworldproblems" id-sequence="943"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Psychology Takes on Real-World Problems</span><h3 id="QJPAUME7ZDTVBNJ8M207" id-sequence="944">Free Will, Suicide, and Cyberbullying</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="TXYT2MYVFMQ8N0WLF725_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="945"> <p id="BGLUWSNT7G5D3CPBQ071" id-sequence="946">Attorneys often remind us that what is “right” is not always legal, and what is legal is not always right. One of the tragic outcomes of cyberbullying is suicide by the victim, leading to the coining of the term <em>bullycide</em>. In spite of the obvious role the bully is playing in these cases, the U.S. legal system is not always able to prove that the victim’s suicide was “caused” by the bully rather than an act of free will.</p> <p id="JTNX0H46SM387B6MR339" id-sequence="947">Several recent cases illustrate the legal challenges in cyberbullying cases. In 2010, Tyler Clementi jumped to his death in the Hudson River after realizing his roommate and a friend had livestreamed images of Clementi having sex with another man. Although the roommate was found guilty of all the charges brought by the prosecution, his sentence was 30 days in jail. In 2007, 47-year-old Lori Drew played a terrible trick on one of her daughter’s friends, Megan Meier, after the two girls had a falling out. Drew impersonated a boy online and convinced Megan the boy liked her. Subsequently, Drew posted a note to Megan saying that “the world would be a better place without you.” Megan hung herself, but in the absence of any relevant statutes, Drew went completely unpunished.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1557 rs_skip" id="JXRBAPGTF9ZC915HX261" clrenderdata="[&quot;KCWJMBZB2D5HXUE8H714&quot;]" id-sequence="948"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf35-t2.jpg" data-width="220" data-height="276" data-alt="Rutgers first-year student Tyler Clementi, a gifted violinist, committed suicide when he discovered that his roommate had secretly filmed him having sex with another man and had broadcast the film on the Internet.

The current legal system, based on long traditions of free will, does not hold bullies responsible for a victim’s suicide unless they inflict severe physical injury or make the victim mentally irresponsible (<span class="citation" id="XXXBAWKP7M8XAE1WJ613" id-sequence="951">Rogers, 2014</span>). Changes in legal interpretations that consider the special nature of cyberbullying might result in more intuitively “fair” outcomes. If the legal system takes into account the imbalance of power that commonly exists between a cyberbully and victim, the nature and severity of the bullying, and the ability of the victim to avoid the bullying, it might become more likely for perpetrators like Lori Drew to be held accountable for their actions.</p> </div></div> <div class="container dependent mt_summary narrative  rs_skip" id="GKZN2XL7MMDXJGAF0250" label="summary" id-sequence="952"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Summary <span class="ordinal">6.3</span></span><h3 id="UGGNJ4A5YF4BN9UE3038" id-sequence="953">Commonly Used Psychoactive Drugs and Their Methods of Action</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="GKZN2XL7MMDXJGAF0250_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="954"> <div class="table rs_skip" id="ULJV2ZPZP5QKTXPUQ725" id-sequence="955"> <div class="maintable narrowtable widetable longtable" style="height: 711px;"><table data-width="600" class="frameall" style="width: 800px;"> <colgroup><col width="400"><col width="400"></colgroup> <thead> <tr id="MFCQ7RRBJCFBPQQ6L612" id-sequence="956"> <th id="GWKSFR7NXKX339P24476" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="957"><p id="XQZLSF5J4PWQXVFKD820" id-sequence="958">Drug class</p></th> <th id="RCPGAJQWYBUFB7HUJ272" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore sidescore" id-sequence="959"><p id="LAMNWR5CNPYDMLU5G335" id-sequence="960">Acts on</p></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody id="GCHN0F0KBQA5K8922702" id-sequence="961"> <tr class="odd" id="JPNN10GUMFW17T61K920" id-sequence="962"> <td id="ZMLSA1499VAPJN0ZN390" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="963"><p id="WTWFTJZ6ZP177UVXB068" id-sequence="964"><strong><em>LSD</em></strong></p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1558 rs_skip" id="WMEH376A2QYGARPXT211" clrenderdata="[&quot;RRSWHKA5Q7HPEJ58L270&quot;]" id-sequence="965"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf36-t2.png" data-width="101" data-height="64" data-alt="An illustration shows the chemical structure of serotonin."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:101px;height:64px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_06_unf36-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="An illustration shows the chemical structure of serotonin." width="101" height="64" class="rs_skip"></div> </div></div></div></td> <td id="HALXYDVAPAP6CJTTM313" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="966"><p id="BGWN5KB347TUVQZZM454" id-sequence="967">Serotonin</p></td> </tr> <tr class="even" id="AMBJW6SS93RXNTUK6387" id-sequence="968"> <td id="PMWKJCV5S6USMH2JH477" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="969"><p id="UBQJ309U41UHT7GR6727" id-sequence="970"><strong><em>Marijuana</em></strong></p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1559 rs_skip" id="HCLQ3C01YLESGXF3H320" clrenderdata="[&quot;SHPJC09MY3RJG66TW193&quot;]" id-sequence="971"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_06_unf37-t2.png" data-width="89" data-height="78" data-alt="A cross sectional view of the brain shows the locations of cannabinoid receptors in the brain, as follows.

Scientists have zoomed in to observe changes that happen in single neurons, like the image on the left, found in simple animals like the <em>Aplysia californica</em> sea slug. The sea slug is capable of learning to anticipate an electric shock that happens every time it is touched, and it demonstrates this knowledge by protectively withdrawing its body in response to touch before the shock is administered. Because the slug has such a simple nervous system compared to ours, scientists have been able to identify which neurons are involved in this learning and to describe the changes in a neuron’s functioning that make new behaviors—like withdrawing prior to shock—possible.</p> <p id="YUZTSWUNPWA0XB15H196" id-sequence="32">Is it possible that human learning has anything in common with learning in slugs? The answer to this question is “yes and no.” Zooming out, we will see that some types of learning are common across animals with vastly different evolutionary histories and complexities, like humans and sea slugs. In other cases, we see interactions between nature and nurture. Experience, or nurture, frequently interacts with the nature of the organism exposed to the experience. You can talk to your kitten<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_281" data-page="281"></a> and to an infant, but only the infant will respond to this experience by learning to understand what you’re saying and how to reply. Each species brings unique and innate building blocks of learning, accumulated over many generations, to any given situation.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15a7 rs_skip" id="EPLBUKUTAW360TT8A812" clrenderdata="[&quot;XEYT5PKGRAAM05KT6147&quot;]" id-sequence="33"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="378" data-height="337" data-alt="Animals respond to the environment with reflexes, instinctive behaviors, and learned behaviors.

Apparently, slugs can communicate with one another using pheromones, and the presence or absence of these chemicals has a powerful effect on their ability to learn (<span class="citation" id="QGBWGKFEZBYNG1NTG416" id-sequence="38">Susswein, Schwarz, &amp; Feldman, 1986</span>).

In casual conversation, we sometimes attribute a baseball player’s high batting average or our ability to step on the brake in time to avoid an automobile accident to great reflexes, but in fact, these examples involve learned behaviors that have become fast and automatic as a result of lots of practice. Nobody is born knowing how to hit baseballs or use the brakes of a car, so these behaviors do not meet this definition of a reflex.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15a8 rs_skip" id="ZUAXCHMZ33GW67WMN184" clrenderdata="[&quot;WQUJVUJWH7X4YWAL0491&quot;]" id-sequence="51"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf03-t2.png" data-width="389" data-height="269" data-alt="A photo shows a man standing waist deep in ice cold water.

No experience with knee-tapping is necessary to produce this behavior, nor can you voluntarily prevent it. By the time your brain realizes your knee was tapped, you have already reacted.

If you’ve ever touched a hot stovetop and found yourself pulling your hand back seemingly before you even knew what you had done, you know at least one benefit of reflexes. Reflexes have the disadvantage of being inflexible. For example, we respond to stress or cold by forming Goose bumps (bumps on the skin). This reflex appears to be left over from when our species had more body hair. Goose bumps raise each strand of hair, which in times of stress makes an individual look larger, scaring off predators or competitors, and, in response to cold, traps more insulating air near the skin. As humans lost most of their body hair over time, the advantages of this reflex decreased, but we still retain the behavior.</p> <p id="GWSV0RRWAN749Z3XF894" id-sequence="58"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b2" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b2"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b2" id="JTGFS5EAQR30B4Z3L554" id-sequence="59"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Instincts</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="AFSR8PUG4BQA63TFD004" id-sequence="60">Instincts</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">An inborn pattern of behavior elicited by environmental stimuli; also known as a <em>fixed action pattern</em>.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b2">

</span>, also called <em>fixed action patterns</em>, are inborn patterns of behavior elicited by environmental stimuli. Once they begin, instinctive behaviors run until completion. Instincts share reflexes’ reliability and lack of dependence on experience, but the resulting behaviors are more complex, requiring many more neurons than the number involved in a reflexive kick of your foot. Instinctive behaviors occur in the mating and parenting behaviors of many species (<span class="citation" id="DZYMTK815E5GLRR4K483" id-sequence="61">Tinbergen, 1951</span>). For example, a mother dog instinctively licks clean her first litter of pups immediately after birth. An example of a human instinct is yawning. Once a yawn is initiated, it is difficult to stop.</p> <p id="VHSZ3Y4ZJ0RNTXEUD690" id-sequence="62">Psychologists define <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b3" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b3"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b3" id="XPYK29FDFXSM3WHY5093" id-sequence="63"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">learning</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="CZELDVHFYSJDBE6YJ625" id-sequence="64">learning</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A relatively permanent change in behavior or the capacity for behavior due to experience.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10b3">

</span> as a relatively permanent change in behavior (or in the capacity for behavior) due to experience. The core of this definition is the phrase <em>change in behavior</em>. After learning, we can do something new that we couldn’t do before, providing us with enormous advantages in surviving a changing world. Not all changes in behavior take place because of learning, however. Our behavior changes as we mature from infancy through adulthood, as we will see in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-element-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415">Chapter 11</a>. Behavior can be changed by brain damage or by having a psychological disorder. So our definition of learning limits the changes we consider to be learned to those that result from experience. The other qualification in this definition, “relatively permanent,” prevents the labeling of brief or unstable changes—such as when we experience different moods or suffer from an illness—as learning. The extent to which learning is really permanent will be discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-element-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946">Chapter 9</a>.</p> <p id="UCNSU4MVFZ9ZCL0QA442" id-sequence="65">In the 20th century, psychology was dominated by the beliefs that, compared to other animals, humans have relatively few reflexes and instincts and that most human behavior results from learning. William James argued that humans have more instincts than other animals, although we are usually unaware of them (<span class="citation" id="DXVH1EQ2U6GH08LEN402" id-sequence="66">James, 1887</span>). He believed that our behavior simply appears more complex and thoughtful because we often face the need to choose among competing instincts. Animals with fewer instincts experience fewer conflicts, so their behavior appears to be more automatic and less thoughtful.</p> <p id="YHZV73PWBCC2M7RJA253" id-sequence="67">James’s approach to instinct and learning is echoed in the writings of contemporary evolutionary psychologists, who argue for an innate learning instinct that prepares humans to learn certain things in particular ways based on our evolutionary history (<span class="citation" id="KBUPHZVX7L0NMQB6H089" id-sequence="68">Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1997</span>). Cognitive psychologists also revive the flavor of James by suggesting that learned behavior resulting from experience can look automatic and instinctive (<span class="citation" id="UXXTYV8BPUZXWBJRW228" id-sequence="69">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 1999</span>). For example, prejudice toward a group of people requires learning, but prejudiced behavior often occurs without much conscious awareness, as explored further in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-element-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377">Chapter 13</a>.

After detecting one harmful stimulus, raising our overall level of responsiveness should improve reaction time should other dangers arise.</p> <p id="PZDTT4GU7T6RMMLW1250" id-sequence="108"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10ba" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10ba"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10ba" id="ZYXJ0EV47MVCYSFM7005" id-sequence="109"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Observational learning</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="XXHVWHF4YS64J2PY2719" id-sequence="110">Observational learning</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Learning that occurs when one organism watches the actions of another organism; also known as <em>social learning</em> or <em>modeling</em>.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10ba">

</span>, also known as <em>social learning</em> or <em>modeling</em>, occurs when one organism learns by watching the actions of another organism. If your knowledge of table manners does not extend to the many forks, knives, and spoons at a fancy dinner, you might want to watch what others do before diving into your food.

<em>Pavlovian conditioning</em>. Pavlov switched his interests from the study of digestion to the study of learning after noticing that his dogs had learned to anticipate the arrival of food. Instead of salivating when presented with food, his dogs began to salivate as soon as the lab assistant retrieved them from the kennel or strapped them into their experimental harnesses in the laboratory. Most people would probably not have noticed the differences in the dogs’ behavior. Pavlov not only noticed but realized the full significance of his observations: the dogs had formed an association between the stimuli preceding the food and the arrival of the food. In other words, the dogs had learned that certain stimuli served as signals for the eventual appearance of food (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BFHR96PLWUWF2NQZQ110" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-section-id="TKEHB5EE9P1DX7DS0987" data-element-id="BFHR96PLWUWF2NQZQ110">Figure 8.1</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15b2 rs_skip" id="BFHR96PLWUWF2NQZQ110" clrenderdata="[&quot;WFJY83AKNAEP4APPP285&quot;]" id-sequence="177"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_08_f01-t3.png" data-width="865" data-height="556"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_f01-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="381" data-alt="A set of four illustrations show the process of classical conditioning in case of a dog.

By turning on the metronome before delivering food, Pavlov established the ticking sound as the CS, while the food was the UCS. A UCS may be pleasant, like food, but it may also be unpleasant, like an electric shock. The important features of a UCS are its innate biological significance and its reliable ability to elicit a response without prior exposure. Just as dogs don’t require training to salivate in response to meat powder, few of us need experience with electric shock before we respond with fear and other negative emotions.</p> <p id="GZKL1N3MBGRECZADP631" id-sequence="194"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10bd" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10bd"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10bd" id="RRRGAS0PBH8XR4J0U127" id-sequence="195"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Conditioned responses (CRs)</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="AJJKVKQJZGV6BQH9N617" id-sequence="196">Conditioned responses (CRs)</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A response learned through classical conditioning.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10bd">

Now we continue to present light–shock pairings, but we add other training trials that include the inhibitory CS—a sound—by presenting the light and sound together, followed by no shock. Even though the light is present, the rat learns that it is not going to be shocked in the presence of the sound, and it shows no fear.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_289" data-page="289"></a> <p id="BRXQGU0ZHXVPDCD3C654" id-sequence="240">For a vulnerable animal in the wild, it is important to know not only that a predator at a water hole is in hunting mode (the sight of a prowling predator is an excitatory CS eliciting fear), but also that a predator relaxing after a recent kill is unlikely to kill again soon (the sight of a predator calmly drinking water is an inhibitory CS that tells the animal that the predator is unlikely to attack soon and therefore it is safe).

Its demonstration led to a substantial rethinking not only of classical conditioning, but of behaviorism in general. Pavlov believed that stimuli that met the CS or UCS criteria could be successfully paired to produce classical conditioning. He made no provisions in his theory for special interactions between particular types of stimuli. John Garcia, who had a background not only in psychology but also in biology, did not believe that stimuli were so interchangeable. In what became known as a classic taste aversion study, Garcia and Koelling (1966) demonstrated that the types of stimuli used as CSs and UCSs matter, and that some combinations are learned faster than others. Garcia and Koelling presented groups of rats with either saccharin-flavored water (“tasty water”) or plain water. When the rats consumed the plain water, their drinking triggered a light and a clicking sound, which the researchers called “bright-noisy water.” After drinking either tasty or bright-noisy water, half the rats were given an injection of lithium chloride, which produces strong sensations of nausea, and the other half received an electric shock (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RKVVPSWKJ7X8ULV51959" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-section-id="BGSN9KCTVB3789P9E391" data-element-id="RKVVPSWKJ7X8ULV51959">Table 8.1</a>).</p> <div class="table rs_skip" id="RKVVPSWKJ7X8ULV51959" id-sequence="299"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Table <span class="ordinal">8.1</span></span><h3 id="LQDFM8G0YWEC4MK73603" id-sequence="300">Experimental Design Used by Garcia and Koelling (1966)</h3></div> <div class="maintable narrowtable" style="height: auto;"><table data-width="380" class="frameall" style="width: 507px;"> <colgroup><col width="173"><col width="160"><col width="173"></colgroup> <thead> <tr id="ZHVVT3Z36EVV29YHF360" id-sequence="301"> <th id="DJAWP018VRS47KLWN764" class="alignleft valignbottom" id-sequence="302"></th> <th id="QYFU7T0NM293K5F9T030" colspan="2" class="aligncenter valignbottom underscore sidescore" id-sequence="303"><p id="AXXHPW94UJZ0D6D96777" id-sequence="304">Conditioned stimulus</p></th> </tr> <tr id="AZRNE6DSB859EK6P9294" id-sequence="305"> <th id="YCPRVZJ968Y601DEL489" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="306"><p id="AUSH4HEYL38PZGH81889" id-sequence="307">Unconditioned stimulus</p></th> <th id="VDVU5KG4NARJ29TJD951" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="308"><p id="RJEHK9581BFN1AQHS998" id-sequence="309">Bright-noisy water</p></th> <th id="LKLBW3SPBCB7ME4TZ343" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore sidescore" id-sequence="310"><p id="LPPSV7F0HAN0ZAPXY627" id-sequence="311">Tasty water</p></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody id="EEXC6RWH00TXNKA2S592" id-sequence="312"> <tr class="odd" id="XLVHHA70LH4AZKMR8734" id-sequence="313"> <td id="UBZANQ4XQENMM1P3Y273" class="alignleft valigntop" id-sequence="314"><p id="HUMMECU7S7VQB0ZWL314" id-sequence="315">Lithium chloride (LiCl)</p></td> <td id="EDAW88GFV2PLVBY5K963" class="alignleft valigntop" id-sequence="316"><p id="UBHAUJMD4LSC7KT5L484" id-sequence="317">Weak learning</p></td> <td id="CKBV6RXFBUVCEPFWG172" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore" id-sequence="318"><p id="BXMLRXPLY8YSD3QD1011" id-sequence="319">Strong learning</p></td> </tr> <tr class="even" id="QKRUN1MV6QJJ7MTS7562" id-sequence="320"> <td id="DYDNSNZB3EJSRNZXA970" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="321"><p id="NWPDGBBLDKLBNCL6P820" id-sequence="322">Shock</p></td> <td id="ZLSHM708HAVB6H6J7384" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="323"><p id="ZLFE288MZGK3AH42V329" id-sequence="324">Strong learning</p></td> <td id="ZVGBT9CYQ0ZNQY4JK898" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="325"><p id="ZRXJ2R0QQLW6F9UQ4396" id-sequence="326">Weak learning</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> </div> <p id="GWELKT0XGJNTN056M710" id-sequence="327">This type of experiment should look familiar to you by now as an example of classical conditioning. Tasty water or bright-noisy water served as CSs, while shock or lithium chloride served as UCSs. Garcia and Koelling subsequently presented tasty and bright-noisy water to see whether either would be avoided, with avoidance serving as an indication of the CR of disgust with or dislike of the water. Rats immediately learned associations between tasty water and subsequent illness but had difficulty learning to use the bright-noisy water as a signal for illness. Conversely, bright-noisy water, but not tasty water, became an effective signal for shock. After all, if you feel sick, you are more likely to decide that your illness was a result of eating mystery leftovers for breakfast rather than the flickering of the fluorescent lights in your classroom. However, if you receive an electric shock, you might be more suspicious of the flickering lights than of your breakfast.</p> <p id="LTYX30TW0MDCA6FVL510" id-sequence="328">This experiment had far-ranging implications. Not only did these findings challenge Pavlov’s views of the relative interchangeability of stimuli, but they also prompted a renewed interest in the biological predispositions of organisms, or their preparedness to learn certain things. Although rats readily formed associations between taste and illness, but not between visual stimuli and illness, birds easily formed associations between visual stimuli and illness, but not between taste and illness. Rats see poorly, so they usually depend on taste and smell for identifying food. Birds have excellent vision and typically identify food sources using visual cues, such as the markings of particular species of butterfly.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15bb rs_skip" id="TBQHVYC21SHDSH0BX015" clrenderdata="[&quot;NQERMVHVMRXSLUDNY320&quot;]" id-sequence="329"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf16-t2.jpg" data-width="288" data-height="283" data-alt="A photo shows two monarch butterflies placed one below another.

The milkweed on which the monarch caterpillar feeds contains cardiac glycosides, which are maintained in the mature insects’ bodies. Ingested glycosides make the birds ill, so they avoid feeding on monarchs, as would be predicted by classical conditioning. Some scientists believe that by looking similar to the monarch, the viceroy butterfly (on the bottom) might escape being eaten too. Recall that visual stimuli (“bright—noisy” water) were not very effective signals for illness in rats, but apparently they work just fine for birds.

One hypothesis suggests that Albert was Douglas Merritte, the child of one of the foster mothers living at the Harriet Lane home in 1920. Merritte died at age 6 of hydrocephalus. Another strong candidate is William Albert Barger, whose name and physical health appear to some to be a better match for the baby shown in Watson’s films of his experiment. Barger died in 2007, at the age of 87. If Barger is indeed the famous Albert, we hope that his strong dislike of animals as an adult was not a remnant of Watson’s experiment.</p> </div></div> <p id="CNWZ65473EXD5NC01275" id-sequence="346">In 1920, John B. Watson and Rosalie Raynor conducted an experiment with a 9-month-old infant named Albert. By today’s standards, this experiment hardly appears well designed or ethical, but the results of the experiment led to research that shed a great deal of light onto human fear. While Albert played with a tame, white laboratory rat (CS), Watson and Raynor made a loud noise (UCS) by hitting a steel bar with a hammer. Albert was quite frightened by this noise (UCR). A week later, Albert was again offered the rat, but this time, he was afraid (CR). His fear generalized to other white, furry objects, including a rabbit, a dog, a fur coat, and a Santa Claus mask. Watson and Raynor had successfully demonstrated that fears could result from classical conditioning.</p> <p id="WALTAUL5F4YAQT4K3545" id-sequence="347">Although Albert left Watson and Raynor’s laboratory without treatment for his fear, one of Watson’s students, Mary Cover Jones, demonstrated how classical conditioning procedures could be used to reduce learned fears. Her experiment featured a 3-year-old named Peter, who had a serious phobia, or intense, unrealistic fear, of rabbits (<span class="citation" id="XGSCXV43UVTNPS2LG799" id-sequence="348">Jones, 1924</span>). Could classical conditioning provide a way to reduce Peter’s fears? One possible approach would be to use extinction. As mentioned previously, CRs extinguish if the CS is presented alone, without the UCS. Treating phobias by exposing people to fear-producing stimuli in a manner that is safe until they no longer respond (i.e., extinction) is known as <em>exposure therapy</em> or <em>flooding</em>. Although exposure therapy works, it is often traumatic. Being exposed to a stimulus you find frightening until you are no longer afraid is not fun. Imagine forcing a person afraid of heights to bungee jump until the fear of heights has gone.</p> <p id="MKVKKAPXJMQPKR55C481" id-sequence="349">Instead of using exposure therapy, Jones treated Peter with counterconditioning, or the substitution of one CR for another, opposite response. Jones associated food, a new UCS, with the presence of a rabbit (CS). Eventually, Peter was able to stroke the rabbit while eating. While not particularly hygienic, this achievement represented a big improvement in Peter’s life.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15bc rs_skip" id="VEJRE6RJA1XSSRPMB346" clrenderdata="[&quot;AGXKNR9DNXP5CHM36944&quot;]" id-sequence="350"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf17-t2.jpg" data-width="344" data-height="221" data-alt="A photo shows back of a girl dressed as a ballerina peeping from behind a curtain."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="RDYZD56NV3PTTQY9V963" id-sequence="351"><p>Understanding classical conditioning provides insight into many situations where our emotional responses seem to be triggered by the environment, as in the case of performance anxiety.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:344px;height:221px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_08_unf17-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows back of a girl dressed as a ballerina peeping from behind a curtain." width="344" height="221" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit"><a target="_blank" id="HECNVFC5G6UXC0RYN202" name="HECNVFC5G6UXC0RYN202" class="external" href="http://iStock.com" id-sequence="352">iStock.com</a>/oleg66 </div> </div></div></div> <p id="GZAMAZD9Y433T8HP1320" id-sequence="353">Counterconditioning has many useful applications. <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10c7" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10c7"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10c7" id="WDFC4MY3Q18WZHY1J251" id-sequence="354"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Aversion therapy</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="ATXSLKVWQS0QC8XEG986" id-sequence="355">Aversion therapy</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">An application of counterconditioning in which a conditioned stimulus (CS) formerly paired with a pleasurable unconditioned stimulus (UCS) is instead paired with an unpleasant UCS.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10c7">

Associations between a phobic stimulus and fear are replaced by associations between the phobic stimulus and relaxation. The person undergoing treatment is first trained to achieve a state of physical and mental relaxation, usually by tensing and relaxing muscle groups from head to toe. If you would like to try this progressive relaxation technique yourself, we outline the procedure in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-element-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551">Chapter 15</a>. Once relaxation is achieved, the fear stimulus is gradually introduced, either in physical form, through guided imagery, in which the person is asked to imagine the stimulus, or by using virtual reality. If relaxation falters at any point, the person retreats to an earlier stage of exposure to the fear stimulus until he or she can relax again.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="TWMVU85QNWHUVE464280" id-sequence="361"> <h3 id="LGGPFMQJMKJ304UVD851" id-sequence="362"><span class="headingText">Addiction</span></h3> <p id="JLEBUX01RYDLGBVE5563" id-sequence="363">In addition to the influences on addiction discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-chapter-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-element-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957">Chapter 6</a>, classical conditioning can contribute to dependence on a drug or behavior.

There is nothing about avoiding the use of a drug that substantially weakens the previously formed associations surrounding its use. Consequently, being exposed to established CSs, including the people with whom one did the drugs previously or the context in which one used the drugs, often leads to a former addict’s relapse (<span class="citation" id="NKVFMDCDXEELEZS5V231" id-sequence="368">Chaudhri, Sahuque, &amp; Janak, 2008</span>). The sight, smell, or taste of a recovering alcoholic’s favorite drink, or even a visit to a favorite bar, is often enough to undermine the person’s abstinence from drinking. Reducing these associations through extinction can help the addict continue to abstain.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15be rs_skip" id="HECD83YW9H2KQG1AN919" clrenderdata="[&quot;GHZMT11C0AFR5RWBC106&quot;]" id-sequence="369"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf19-t3.jpg" data-width="679" data-height="462"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf19-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="404" data-alt="While still a graduate student, Mary Cover Jones used classical conditioning principles to reduce a small child’s fear of rabbits.

After all, advertisers have been using classical conditioning for years to influence consumer attitudes about products.

Like other attitudes, it is influenced by classical conditioning, although it has many other roots as well. In particular, latent inhibition can contribute to the development of negative attitudes (Cacioppo, Marshall-Goodell, Tassinary, &amp; Petty, 1992). Consider the following. Because of latent inhibition, if children grow up with little exposure to people outside their own race, people of their own race are more familiar, and learning to associate their race with other attributes should be slow. In contrast, the children have had less preexposure to people of other races. Latent inhibition would predict that children exposed to news reports about crime would form stronger associations between people of unfamiliar races and crime than between people of their own race and crime.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15bf rs_skip" id="VDFQTMKSTC8JP6WU0505" clrenderdata="[&quot;PVKKXBVE2FNR4UU9G192&quot;]" id-sequence="376"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf21-t2.jpg" data-width="443" data-height="281" data-alt="A photo shows two men sitting by a dining table.

This difference means that creative people and people with schizophrenia form new associations with familiar stimuli faster than most people do. They make connections under circumstances in which most of us would not. Reduced latent inhibition might account for the creative person’s ability to see familiar things in new ways, which is a positive outcome, but it also might lead to the tendency of a person with schizophrenia to make odd, inappropriate connections among ideas. <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a> refers to this tendency as a “loosening of associations.” For example, a person with schizophrenia might suggest that a painting has a headache.

One of the less typical applications was the result of work by John Garcia and one of his graduate students, Carl<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_296" data-page="296"></a> Gustavson (<span class="citation" id="XWXWTRT5Q9UY16V1N660" id-sequence="391">Gustavson, Kelly, Sweeney, &amp; Garcia, 1976</span>). Gustavson was a child of the rural West, and he had grown up watching the ongoing battles among sheep ranchers, coyotes, and wolves. He asked whether the taste aversion work pioneered by Garcia might provide a useful solution.</p> <p id="KCDWHUN03STP2MZ3E261" id-sequence="392">With encouragement from Garcia, Gustavson set up an outdoor training facility with six coyotes and two wolves. The coyotes were fed rabbit meat laced with lithium chloride (LiCl), while the wolves were fed sheep meat with LiCl. He even experimented with a caged cougar that refused to eat deer meat after a single meal of venison laced with LiCl. Some of the researchers’ observations of the captive animals were especially dramatic. When a lamb was tethered in the wolves’ pen, the wolves approached in a normally threatening manner. The lamb froze, which is also species-typical behavior in this situation. Then, something interesting happened. The wolves sniffed at the lamb and then retreated, showing signs of defensive puppy play (crouching with ears and tail down). In response to these submissive displays, the lamb began to charge the wolves and even chased them around the pen.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15c1 rs_skip" id="CRBEHF1TFGVXVY2A6280" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZSVMK9KJCED8KV4MW552&quot;]" id-sequence="393"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf23-t2.jpg" data-width="404" data-height="289" data-alt="Use of conditioned taste aversion to provide a nonlethal method of predator control is being explored in efforts to save the endangered Mexican wolf, shown here.

The researchers distributed sheep-flavored bait and sheep carcasses laced with LiCl across a 3,000-acre sheep ranch in Washington State. A comparison of the ranch’s loss records demonstrated a 30% to 60% reduction in sheep killed by coyotes following the treatment. A larger-scale test of 10 herds over a 3-year period in Saskatchewan demonstrated a reduction in predator control costs of between 86% and 90% per year.</p> <p id="RETVWR6HL8Z28KFB2911" id-sequence="396">Where does the practice stand today? Unfortunately, when wildlife experts attempted to apply taste aversion to predator control, they made numerous procedural mistakes. They viewed the LiCl as a repellant, as opposed to a UCS. The bait was overdosed with LiCl, which ensured that the predator would link salty tastes with illness instead of the taste of the prey with illness, leading to the discarding of the procedure as ineffective. Contemporary coyote management techniques include propane cannons, horns, sirens, radios, and strobe lights (we are left wondering what these stimuli do to the sheep …), but aversion conditioning is still described by wildlife experts as “speculative” (Wilbanks, 1995, p. 163).</p> <p id="MYKLN9QW7ZVQ0LRUD419" id-sequence="397">Gustavson’s technique has recently made a comeback in an effort to save the endangered Mexican wolf. When released in the wild, the wolves, like Gustavson’s coyotes, naturally run into conflict with ranchers and farmers. Professors Lowell Nicolaus and Dan Moriarty’s initial results using conditioned taste aversion with captive gray wolves convinced U.S. government wildlife agencies to prepare to replicate the study with captive Mexican wolves (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2014). A total of 23 Mexican wolves were treated between 2011 and 2013. Two animals treated in 2011 were retested in 2012, and both still showed a conditioned aversion to cattle (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2014).</p> </div></div> <div class="container dependent mt_summary narrative  rs_skip" id="JFTY26WDA44SFF14A200" label="summary" id-sequence="398"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Summary <span class="ordinal">8.2</span></span><h3 id="VSWUQ96BLZ8FKVTQH474" id-sequence="399">Classical Conditioning Phenomena</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="JFTY26WDA44SFF14A200_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="400"> <div class="table rs_skip" id="FUPG72AFV2J5SLSJH799" id-sequence="401"> <div class="maintable narrowtable longtable" style="height: 711px;"><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_297" data-page="297"></a><table data-width="450" class="frameall" style="width: 600px;"> <colgroup><col width="200"><col width="200"><col width="200"></colgroup> <thead> <tr id="DHNYMN5JVHT00130K769" id-sequence="402"> <th id="BBRZQG2J00VSDD56K458" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="403"><p id="SVGHY1QUT8GEA6U7W395" id-sequence="404">Classical conditioning phenomenon</p></th> <th id="FAYXCA6GM2YSK52C6218" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore" id-sequence="405"><p id="BYZU8YTX3TS3UFRNF013" id-sequence="406">Description</p></th> <th id="CTPJ7GDFLPJ86PDKP774" class="alignleft valignbottom underscore sidescore" id-sequence="407"><p id="NCRNPM7BVNWFXK7CE752" id-sequence="408">Example</p></th></tr> </thead> <tbody id="VYLQ5Z8A6JRN43FBR705" id-sequence="409"> <tr class="odd" id="EVDTB98Y44LDCS84Q190" id-sequence="410"> <td id="CKRGXCC58ZZWS8BEN577" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="411"><p id="AQFCBB70BW9HHQUAB489" id-sequence="412"><strong><em>Acquisition</em></strong></p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15c2 rs_skip" id="HKPA74ZK7JYV6CP3W217" clrenderdata="[&quot;RNTUN0UU5SYJTRTWN408&quot;]" id-sequence="413"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf23-t2.png" data-width="93" data-height="72" data-alt="A line graph shows the rate of acquisition of the conditioned response with every successive session.

To recap, Thorndike had observed the learning that took place when a cat tried to escape one of his “puzzle boxes.” According to Thorndike, the cats learned to escape by repeating actions that produced desirable outcomes and by eliminating behaviors that produced what he called “annoying” outcomes, or outcomes featuring either no useful effects or negative effects (1913, p. 50). Consequently, the law of effect states that a behavior will be “stamped into” an organism’s repertoire depending on the consequences of the behavior (<span class="citation" id="WCZAJCXD6RXW0WYLP707" id-sequence="484">Thorndike, 1913</span>, p. 129).</p> <p id="WJFP9C1UCUYR8UNU7136" id-sequence="485">The association between a behavior and its consequences is called <em>operant</em> or <em>instrumental conditioning</em>. In this type of learning, organisms operate on their environment, and their behavior is often instrumental in producing an outcome. B. F. Skinner extended Thorndike’s findings using an apparatus that bears his name—the Skinner box, a modified cage containing levers or buttons that can be pressed or pecked by animals (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KCFUE2D75Z2JA2SZN421" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-section-id="YPCPEHRCWUQAS0ZUJ960" data-element-id="KCFUE2D75Z2JA2SZN421">Figure 8.7</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15ca rs_skip" id="KCFUE2D75Z2JA2SZN421" clrenderdata="[&quot;HGDESEZC3FSRRHVDF698&quot;]" id-sequence="486"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_f07-t2.png" data-width="476" data-height="479" data-alt="An illustrative image shows a box popularly known as the Skinner box, with a rat inside it.

You might think that getting an A in a course is reinforcing, making all those extra hours spent studying worthwhile, but top grades may be less meaningful to the student sitting next to you, who came to college for the social life. A parent might spank a child, believing that spanking is an effective form of punishment, only to find that the child’s unwanted behavior is becoming more rather than less frequent. For some children, the reward of getting the parent’s attention overrides the discomfort of the spanking part of the interaction. In other words, the identity of a reinforcer or punisher is defined by its effects on behavior, not by some intrinsic quality of the consequence. The only accurate way to determine the impact of a consequence is to check your results. If you think you’re reinforcing or punishing a behavior but the frequency of the behavior is not changing in the direction you expect, try something else.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="CAQLP1JQ8QTXMQ81C464" id-sequence="524"> <h3 id="XFMG88SCCXRBMG9AF843" id-sequence="525"><span class="headingText">Positive Reinforcement</span></h3> <p id="GSQPH9ZP3Q5RZ14AD346" id-sequence="526">By definition, a positive reinforcement increases the frequency of its associated behavior by providing a desired outcome. Again, each person has a menu of effective reinforcements. In a common application of operant conditioning, children with autism spectrum disorder are taught language, with candy serving as the positive reinforcement. Benjamin Lahey tells of his experience trying to teach a child with autism spectrum disorder to say the syllable “ba” to obtain an M&amp;M candy (<span class="citation" id="QGAEA8EET1K2GFPDQ837" id-sequence="527">Lahey, 1995</span>). After 4 hours without progress, Lahey turned to the child’s mother in frustration, asking her what she thought might be the problem. The mother calmly replied that her son didn’t like M&amp;Ms. Lahey switched to the child’s preferred treat, chopped carrots, and the child quickly began saying “ba.” Chopped carrots are probably not the first reinforcer you would try with a 4-year-old boy, but in this case, they made all the difference.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_thinkingscientifically narrative  rs_skip" id="NHFC8DT3WWHP593SL688" label="thinkingscientifically" id-sequence="528"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Thinking Scientifically </span><h3 id="JMJC92Z6SQX4378V1457" id-sequence="529">Why Do People Deliberately Injure Themselves?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="NHFC8DT3WWHP593SL688_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="530"> <p id="JDDSBNAS27BW72FEH888" id-sequence="531">Edward Thorndike’s Law of effect stipulates that behaviors followed by positive consequences are more likely to be repeated in the future, and that behaviors followed by negative consequences are less likely to be repeated. Why, then, do large numbers of people, particularly in adolescence, engage in self-injury, or deliberate physical damage without suicidal intent (Klonsky &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007)? Up to 25% of teens have tried self-injury at least once (<span class="citation" id="KYXFJDGWXMEFHHPDX464" id-sequence="532">Lovell &amp; Clifford, 2016</span>). Most initiate self-injury while in middle school (grades 6 through 8), and approximately 6% of college students continue to self-injure.</p> <p id="DSENFMQTSU4E827CL919" id-sequence="533">As this chapter has detailed, reward and punishment are in the eye of the beholder. The first challenge that we face in our analysis of self-injury is the assumption that pain is always a negative consequence. For most of us, it is. However, adolescents who engage in self-injury report feelings of relief or calm, despite the obvious pain that they inflict on themselves. Such feelings probably reinforce further bouts of self-injury. Self-injury often occurs in response to feelings of anger, anxiety, and frustration, and alleviation of these negative feelings might reward the injurious behavior (<span class="citation" id="ZRNBUQYH5F79XVFPZ164" id-sequence="534">Klonsky, 2007</span>; <span class="citation" id="BJJTGL7HSJZQEEPRB491" id-sequence="535"> Klonsky &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007</span>). Finally, injury is associated with the release of endorphins, our bodies’ natural opioids. The positive feelings associated with endorphin release also might reinforce the behavior.</p> <p id="JSSDWMT1DXTLYEGCR378" id-sequence="536">Self-injury frequently occurs in people diagnosed with psychological disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse, which are discussed further in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">14</a>.

It is possible, therefore, to rank people’s free-time activities according to their priorities. If Lahey had been able to observe his young client’s eating habits before starting training, it is unlikely that he would have made the mistake of offering M&amp;Ms as reinforcers. The opportunity to engage in a higher-priority activity is always capable of rewarding a lower-priority activity.

In our later discussion of punishment, we will argue that the effects of positive reinforcement are more powerful than the effects of punishment. Unfortunately, in Western culture, we tend to provide relatively little positive reinforcement. We are more likely to hear about our mistakes from our boss than all the things we’ve done correctly. It is possible that we feel entitled to good treatment from others, so we feel that we should not have to provide any reward for reasonably expected behaviors. The problem with this approach is that extinction occurs in operant, as well as in classical, conditioning. A behavior that is no longer reinforced drops in frequency. By ignoring other people’s desirable behaviors instead of reinforcing them, perhaps with a simple thank-you, we risk reducing their frequency.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15cc rs_skip" id="BTZNLUL49REB4EAMC665" clrenderdata="[&quot;TACJNZ98MYTUUG9XQ258&quot;]" id-sequence="545"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf32-t3.jpg" data-width="687" data-height="238"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf32-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="206" data-alt="A photo shows arms of a person wearing bracelets having many scars all over them."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="HAFQ5CGMZ8ZXSHT9T131" id-sequence="546"><p>According to the Premack principle, a preferred activity can be used to reinforce a less preferred activity.

</span>, which sounds contradictory, involves the removal of unpleasant consequences from a situation to increase the frequency of an associated behavior. Negative reinforcement increases the frequency of behaviors that allow an organism to avoid, turn off, or postpone an unpleasant consequence; these are sometimes called <em>escape</em> and <em>avoidance behaviors</em>.</p> <p id="AGQZ678E0NJZT80KC326" id-sequence="561">Let’s look at a laboratory example of negative reinforcement before tackling real-world examples. If a hungry rat in a Skinner box learns that pressing a bar produces food, a positive consequence, we would expect the frequency of bar pressing to increase. This would be an instance of positive reinforcement. However, if pressing the bar turns off or delays the administration of an electric shock, we would still expect the frequency of bar pressing to increase. This would be an instance of negative reinforcement.</p> <p id="JXHCSVYNA1TRYJ4L1461" id-sequence="562">Be careful to avoid confusing negative reinforcement with punishment, which is covered in the next section. By definition, a punishment decreases the frequency of the behaviors that it follows, whereas both positive and negative reinforcers increase the frequency of the behaviors that they follow. Returning to our Skinner box example, the rat’s bar pressing increases following both positive reinforcement (food) and negative reinforcement (turning off a shock). If we shocked the rat every time it pressed the bar (punishment), it would stop pressing the bar quickly.</p> <p id="LQUVBKUPKV12Y53J1604" id-sequence="563">Many everyday behaviors are maintained by negative reinforcement.

Part of the weakness of punishment effects arises from the difficulties of applying punishment effectively in real contexts. Three conditions must be met for punishment to have observable effects on behavior: significance, immediacy, and consistency (<span class="citation" id="CFKHD0C2TUDA9M09F633" id-sequence="577">Schwartz, 1984</span>).</p> <p id="DWHYW510T3SAN3T38290" id-sequence="578">As we observed with reinforcement, consequences have to matter to the person or animal receiving them (i.e., significance). If we use a punisher that is too mild for a particular individual, there is little incentive for that person to change behavior. College campuses usually charge a fairly significant amount of money for parking illegally. However, there will typically be some students for whom that particular punishment is not sufficient to ensure that they will park legally. How high would a parking fee have to be to gain complete compliance on the part of the university community? What if you risked the death penalty for parking illegally? We can be fairly certain that most people would leave their cars at home rather than risk that particular consequence. The point is that punishment can work if a sufficiently severe consequence is selected, but using the amount of force needed to produce results is rarely considered practical and ethical. Free societies have long-standing social prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishments, and these conventions are incompatible with using the force that may be needed to change the behavior of some individuals.</p> <p id="WRKU7D20WEGBLV87R684" id-sequence="579">Immediate punishment is more effective than delayed punishment (i.e., immediacy). For the rat in the Skinner box, delays of just 10 seconds can reduce the effectiveness of electric shock as a punisher. Humans are more capable than rats at bridging long intervals (<span class="citation" id="EBUH4MHFMVRFVAP97124" id-sequence="580">Kamin, 1959</span>). Nonetheless, the same principle holds true. Delayed punishment is less effective than immediate punishment. We should not be too surprised that the months or years that are required to try and convict a serious criminal may greatly reduce the impact of imprisonment on that person’s subsequent behavior.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15cf rs_skip" id="QVMWAFRDPF1HPFFTN650" clrenderdata="[&quot;EBAP4ETAD6HUCGCCV352&quot;]" id-sequence="581"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf36-t2.jpg" data-width="419" data-height="312" data-alt="The likelihood of getting a ticket influences drivers’ behavior.

College students are a prosocial, law-abiding group as a whole, yet many confess to determining their highway speed based on the presence or absence of a police car in their rearview mirrors. The experience of exceeding the speed limit without consequence weakens the ability of the possibility of tickets and fines to influence behavior. However, at intersections known to be controlled by cameras, compliance is generally quite high. If you are certain that running a red light will result in an expensive ticket, it would be foolish to test the system.</p> <p id="LKLZ1RLYNBG0CSJHS927" id-sequence="584">To reduce undesirable behaviors, Skinner recommended extinction as an alternative to punishment (<span class="citation" id="NTZTDTKYK9UKMDM1R077" id-sequence="585">Skinner, 1953</span>). In the discussion of classical conditioning earlier in this chapter,<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_303" data-page="303"></a> the term <em>extinction</em> was used to refer to the disappearance of CRs that occurs when the CS no longer signals the arrival of a UCS. Extinction in operant conditioning has a similar meaning. Learned behaviors stop when they are no longer followed by a reinforcing consequence. Attention is a powerful reinforcer for humans, and ignoring negative behavior should extinguish it. Parents and teachers cannot look the other way when one child is being physically aggressive toward another, but in many other instances, Skinner’s approach is quite successful in reducing the frequency of unwanted behaviors (<span class="citation" id="QAEDVSEB4ARZA96G9140" id-sequence="586">Brown &amp; Elliot, 1965</span>).

In other words, workers would be paid every time they produced a fixed number of products or parts on an assembly line. Most workers find this system less than ideal. If the equipment malfunctions, the worker cannot earn money. Lunch breaks would also then be viewed as loss of income rather than a helpful time of rest. Some examples of piecework remain today, including the work of most physicians, who get paid by the procedure, and service workers like plumbers or hairstylists, who get paid for finishing a specific task.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="RSNGHLY428R7AH8G1813" id-sequence="644"> <h3 id="FRSLHRM3482MPRNU5273" id-sequence="645"><span class="headingText">Variable Ratio Schedules</span></h3> <p id="SRLMYJW9TX9QQUXP9791" id-sequence="646">As in FR schedules, <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf10d0" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10d0"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10d0" id="JWFE1CPEGSNT0NS1K484" id-sequence="647"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">variable ratio (VR) schedules</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="UMFCALFM2E5WJVGCK069" id-sequence="648">variable ratio (VR) schedules</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A schedule of reinforcement in which reinforcement occurs following some variable number of behaviors.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf10d0">

This means that over the course of the session, the rat must press an average of 10 times to receive each food pellet. However, this schedule may mean that only 1 press delivers food on one trial, but 30 presses are required on the next trial. The rat is unable to predict when reinforcement is likely to occur, leading to a high, steady rate of responding in our cumulative record.

Slot machines are human versions of Skinner boxes that use VR schedules. The casino sets the machine to pay off after some average number of plays, but the player doesn’t know whether a payoff will occur after one coin or thousands are inserted. You don’t have to observe the behavior of people playing slot machines long to see a demonstration of the high, steady responding that characterizes the VR schedule. The programming of slot machines can be sophisticated. Slot machines that are located in places where people are unlikely to return (airports and bus stations) pay off less frequently than those in places where people are more likely to play regularly.</p> </div><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_306" data-page="306"></a> <div class="pageSection" id="FBFZXJ6K2V4JK390B979" id-sequence="651"> <h3 id="ECACU1RS5YY4YYXN1809" id-sequence="652"><span class="headingText">Fixed Interval Schedules</span></h3> <p id="DJRGTG0CNA2BX7SLX528" id-sequence="653">Unlike ratio schedules, reinforcement in interval schedules depends on the passage of time rather than the number of responses produced.

Responses that occur before the timer counts down are not reinforced. As soon as the timer counts down to zero, the rat’s next bar press is reinforced, and the timer starts counting down again. In the FI schedule, the interval is the same from trial to trial. Animals and people have a good general sense of the passage of time, leading to a characteristic pattern of responding in FI situations. Reinforcement is followed by a long pause. As the end of the interval is anticipated, responding increases sharply.

</span>.</p> <p id="CMYA6TMF0Q2D04Y9U174" id-sequence="676">The partial reinforcement effect probably occurs because of one of two factors, or a combination of both. First, the transition from continuous reinforcement to extinction is more obvious than the transition from a partial schedule to extinction. If you are accustomed<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_308" data-page="308"></a> to being paid for a babysitting job every time you work, you will definitely notice any of your employer’s failures to pay. In contrast, if your neighbor typically pays you about once a month for raking his yard each weekend, you might not notice right away that he hasn’t paid you for a while. Second, partial schedules teach organisms to persist in the face of nonreinforcement. In a sense, partial schedules teach us to work through periods in which reinforcement does not occur. Consequently, we might view extinction as just another case where continuing to perform might eventually produce reinforcement. When positive behavior is occurring, such as working on your senior thesis regularly despite a much-delayed grade, persistence is an enormous advantage. However, as shown in our earlier example of begging for candy, placing an undesirable behavior on partial reinforcement makes it more difficult to extinguish.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15d6 rs_skip" id="HEZSW36J68CRFR8TR031" clrenderdata="[&quot;HQDKL12SMQU305LZZ670&quot;]" id-sequence="677"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf40-t2.jpg" data-width="459" data-height="299" data-alt="Fishing works according to a variable interval (VI) schedule of reinforcement.

In making these types of choices, animals and people follow the matching law, which states that the relative frequency of responding to one alternative will match the relative reinforcement for responses on that alternative (Herrnstein &amp; Heyman, 1979).

We would assume that if the frequency and magnitude of rewards available in gaming were higher than those in real-life socializing, people would choose to spend their time accordingly.</p> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="684"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="687"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="688" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="689" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="KDHGFKDZSLR2STY2P305" id-sequence="690"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">8-4c</span> <span class="headingText">The Method of Successive Approximations (Shaping)</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="EMZLHW1Y8P8KETSWW854_content" id-sequence="691"> <p id="ZTQJ4H9AKDY025D6S703" id-sequence="692">So far, this discussion of operant conditioning has centered on increasing or decreasing the frequency of a particular behavior.

</span>, or <em>shaping</em>, we begin by reinforcing spontaneous behaviors that are somewhat similar to the target behavior that we want to train. As training continues, we use gradually more stringent requirements for reinforcement until the exact behavior that we want occurs. You can think of shaping as a funnel. Using the table manners example, parents start out with generous criteria for reinforcement (“Thank you for picking up the spoon”) and gradually narrow the criteria (“Thank you for putting the spoon in the food”) until they are reinforcing only the target behavior (“Thank you for using the spoon to eat your applesauce”). One of the most positive features about the shaping process is that behavior doesn’t have to be perfect to produce reinforcement.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15d7 rs_skip" id="BLHJKN1QT0LRVVENV252" clrenderdata="[&quot;XSLC10YFQX9WW6JDP249&quot;]" id-sequence="696"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf41-t2.jpg" data-width="417" data-height="198" data-alt="Whether training imaginary raptors in Jurassic World or real animals, using the method of successive approximations (shaping) can lead to the reliable performance of otherwise low-frequency behaviors.

We have<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_309" data-page="309"></a> to teach them to do so. We begin by making sure the hungry rat understands that food is available in the Skinner box. Using a remote control, we activate the food dispenser a few times. Quickly, the rat forms a classically conditioned association between the sound of the food dispenser (CS) and the arrival of food (UCS) in the cup. However, if we continue to feed the rat in this manner, it is unlikely that it will ever learn to press the bar. Indeed, there is no reason for it to do so because it already is obtaining the food it needs. So, we narrow our criteria for obtaining food from simply existing in the box to standing in the corner of the box that contains the bar. If we press our remote control every time the rat is in the correct corner, it will begin to stay there most of the time. Now we want the rat to rear on its back feet so that it is likely to hit the bar with its front feet on the way down. If we begin to reinforce the rat less frequently for staying in the corner, it will begin to explore. Eventually, the rat is likely to hit the bar with its front feet while exploring, pressing the bar. Now it will begin to press the bar on its own. In the hands of an experienced trainer, this process takes about half an hour.</p> <p id="FQPYD6EC57U5ZE2XN844" id-sequence="699">Shaping involves a delicate tightrope walk between too much and too little reinforcement. If we reinforce too generously, learning stops because there is no incentive for change. If your piano teacher always tells you that your performances are perfect, you will stop trying to improve them. However, if we don’t reinforce frequently enough, the learner becomes discouraged. Reinforcement provides important feedback to the learner, so insufficient reinforcement may slow or stop the learning process.</p> <p id="KGMQTD8TNR7WVBCGB099" id-sequence="700">Teaching a complex behavior requires <em>chaining</em>, or breaking down the behavior into manageable steps. Chaining can be done in a forward direction, such as teaching the letters of the alphabet from A to Z, or in a backward direction, such as teaching the last step in a sequence, then the next to the last, and so on. Chaining can be useful when teaching new skills, such as working independently on academic projects, to children with special needs (<span class="citation" id="JDRFPMXQMRUD3FB8T258" id-sequence="701">Pelios, MacDuff, &amp; Axelrod, 2003</span>). Backward chaining is used by most trainers of animals used in entertainment. For example, dogs have been taught to perform complex dances like the Macarena (<span class="citation" id="YLLXTAUPTBYVELLTQ351" id-sequence="702">Burch &amp; Bailey, 1999</span>). The trainer uses a verbal, gestural, or clicker cue while shaping the last step in the dance. When the dog performs this last step reliably, the trainer adds the next-to-last step, and so on until the entire complex sequence is mastered.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="703"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="706"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="707" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="708" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="BSHJQB76TWEMY8W7T938" id-sequence="709"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">8-4d</span> <span class="headingText">Cognitive, Biological, and Social Influences on Operant Conditioning</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="TDUZDK64ZK06AT64X779_content" id-sequence="710"> <p id="DHSKDB8DVXH6472X8580" id-sequence="711">Even the most radical behaviorists, including Skinner, did not deny the existence of cognitive, social, or biological influences on learning (<span class="citation" id="XQPCGH1VKTDWRNNUJ085" id-sequence="712">Jensen &amp; Burgess, 1997</span>).

</span>. He argued that the rats had learned while just exploring, but that they did not demonstrate their learning until motivated by the food reward to do so. We usually judge whether learning has occurred by observing outward behavior. Tolman’s rats remind us that there is a difference between what has been learned and what is performed.

In their 1961 article titled “The Misbehavior of Organisms” (a wordplay on Skinner’s classic book, <em>The Behavior of Organisms</em>), the Brelands outlined some challenges they encountered while using operant conditioning to train animals for entertainment.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_311" data-page="311"></a> <p id="PUXMZN7QYUVRTHRXV114" id-sequence="733">In one instance, the researchers described how they sought to train a pig to pick up large wooden coins and deposit the coins in a large, wooden “piggy bank.” Initially, all went well. The pig would quickly learn to deposit four or five coins (an example of an FR schedule) for each food reward. Eventually, however, the pig began to work slower and slower, to the point where it couldn’t obtain enough food for the day. Instead of taking the coins to the piggy bank, the pig would repeatedly toss them in the air and sniff around to find them. Raccoons trained with the coins ultimately tried to wash them instead of depositing them in the bank. The animals’ natural approach to food (the rooting by the pigs and the washing by the raccoons) began to interfere with their handling of the coins. You may already have suspected that the coins had become the object of some higher-order classical conditioning because of their relationship with food. The Brelands concluded “that these animals are trapped by strong instinctive behaviors, and clearly we have here a demonstration of the prepotency of such behavior patterns over those which have been conditioned.

Our performance of learned behaviors varies depending on an interaction between the presence of others and the complexity of the learned task. For simple tasks, like pedaling a bicycle or reeling in a fishing line, the presence of others makes us perform faster, a phenomenon known as <em>social facilitation</em> (<span class="citation" id="BHHB4AJA4AR19BBA7815" id-sequence="746">Triplett, 1898</span>; also see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-element-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377">Chapter 13</a>). In complex tasks, such as taking a difficult college entrance exam, the presence of others can make our performance slower and poorer. Again, this effect is not restricted to complex organisms like ourselves; the same results can be observed in the lowly cockroach (<span class="citation" id="EMATX8RWB0DMRSA2E095" id-sequence="747">Zajonc, 1965</span>). In a straight maze leading to food, cockroaches with an audience of other cockroaches ran quickly.

</span>. Money, in the form of coins, bills, bitcoins, or bank statements, is fairly useless. You can’t eat it, wear it, or shelter in it. Nonetheless, people value it because it takes on secondary reinforcing qualities due to its history of association with other things that have intrinsic value. The use of money to buy things of personal value is an example of a token economy. You earn money for doing certain things, and then you have the opportunity to trade the money you earned for items of value to you. This system meets the best practices criteria that have been described in the context of positive reinforcement. Each person can obtain reinforcement that has unique personal value. One friend may spend discretionary money on going out to dinner, while another invests in the stock market. Both find money reinforcing for doing work.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15dc rs_skip" id="HMRBP26PWM1ANZNQ4250" clrenderdata="[&quot;PYGCFUHT8027TT0PQ761&quot;]" id-sequence="767"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf45-t2.jpg" data-width="322" data-height="316" data-alt="A photo shows a woman at a counter handing over her card for payment."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="CTPM96AS0EJLJHX9R592" id-sequence="768"><p>Token economies can be effective ways of managing behavior.

Historically, employers offered a set program of health, retirement, and other benefits to their entire workforce regardless of individual needs. We would expect this approach to be minimally reinforcing because it does not match reinforcers to worker priorities. Catering a benefits package to individual needs is more sensible. A young worker in good health might be more motivated by a benefits package that includes childcare, while a more mature worker may worry about long-term care in the event of a disability. By allowing workers to select their benefits from a menu, everybody can find something worth earning.</p> <p id="GAUED782V5DNHC0UW941" id-sequence="770">All of us respond positively to token economies, but they are especially useful in educational and institutional settings. Teachers provide frequent rewards in the form of checks, stars, or tickets that can be exchanged later for popcorn parties or a night without homework. The key to an effective token economy is to offer ultimate rewards that are truly valuable to the people you wish to motivate. If students don’t care about popcorn parties, offering them will have little effect. Token economies are equally useful in prison settings and in institutions serving people with an intellectual disability or mental illness.</p> </div><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_313" data-page="313"></a> <div class="pageSection" id="FAKESVHPNT05251KS332" id-sequence="771"> <h3 id="WZJKCYYTJEDB4W0DL316" id-sequence="772"><span class="headingText">Behavior Therapies</span></h3> <p id="JAKVKEWEKFSWF7GV7649" id-sequence="773">As we will discuss in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-element-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551">Chapter 15</a>, learning theories also have been applied successfully to the clinical setting in the form of behavior therapies, also called <em>applied behavior analysis</em>.

Maybe we eat poorly, drink too much, smoke, or lash out angrily at others. An understanding of the processes of learning provides us with powerful tools for changing behavior. Let’s assume that your eating habits, like those of many students, do not meet the “My mom would approve” standard. Yet you are learning in your psychology course that good health habits are essential tools for managing stress (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-element-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075">Chapter 16</a>). How do you bring about the necessary changes?</p> <p id="AJTUX1SWA98WPFA35918" id-sequence="784">Before doing anything to produce change, you need to understand your current behavior. Many people have a poor understanding of what they actually eat during a day, so you could start by keeping a diary. What foods, and how much of them, do you eat? What else is going on when you eat well or poorly? What possible reinforcers or punishers are influencing your eating patterns? For example, let’s say that you observe a tendency to eat high-calorie snacks late at night while studying, even when you are not hungry. Your goal, then, is to eliminate these late-night snacks. Your baseline shows that your snacking is a social behavior. You consume these extra foods only when studying with a group. The social camaraderie and good taste of the food serve as powerful reinforcers for the behavior.</p> <p id="RUJPF11MG9DU9G5VY517" id-sequence="785">Now that you have a better understanding of your problem behavior, you are in a good position to construct a plan. An important part of your plan is to choose appropriate consequences for your behavior. Again, it is essential that we design consequences that are meaningful to individuals. As we have argued in this chapter, positive reinforcement has many advantages over punishment. You might try placing the money you’re saving on junk food in a designated jar to buy a special (nonfood) treat at the end of a successful week, or allow yourself an extra study break each night that you meet your goals. If you are convinced that the only way that you will change is through punishment, you could take an alternative approach. Although some people have successfully stopped smoking through the use of positive punishment, including electric shock (<span class="citation" id="TESFXJD6EAAWJ7Y2R022" id-sequence="786">Law &amp; Tang, 1995</span>), this sounds quite unpleasant. Instead, a negative punishment, such as losing texting privileges for the day following a failure to meet one’s goals, might work.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15de rs_skip" id="VHCT1BDBTAHSQNKH3952" clrenderdata="[&quot;FQJHNN1FKGPFW7Z36529&quot;]" id-sequence="787"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf47-t2.jpg" data-width="307" data-height="196" data-alt="A note lists New Year’s resolutions, as follows.

Learning occurs without personally experiencing negative consequences. This ability to learn from observing others greatly expands our learning capacity, especially when we then generalize from these concrete examples (watching successful students) to produce effective rules (good time management is important to being a successful student). Observational learning also can have a dark side, as will be seen in our later discussion of the pioneering work by Albert Bandura and his colleagues (<span class="citation" id="DADUEG548247CMGG1703" id-sequence="854">Bandura, Ross, &amp; Ross, 1963</span>; <span class="citation" id="EJLTTQBTP255JGLW8250" id-sequence="855"> Bandura, 1965</span>) on the modeling of aggression by children.</p> <p id="QEXCEQAHA49U780DL599" id-sequence="856">Not only do we learn by observing others, but it appears that observational learning can override other influences on behavior, possibly because we are such a social species. Parents learn (often the hard way) that children are more likely to pattern behavior after what they observe their parents doing than after what they hear their parents say.</p> <p id="EQSBVXK85GW6FGKC7356" id-sequence="857">Various behaviors, both positive and negative, appear to be influenced by observation, including aggression, achievement motivation, language development, phobias, cognitive development, moral judgment, and suicidal behavior. People benefit greatly from exposure to positive role models, especially those with whom they can identify. We worry<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_315" data-page="315"></a> about the relatively small number of women in university math and science faculties, not only because of the possibility of discrimination, but also because seeing women in these positions might inspire young girls to follow in their footsteps. However, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by sports heroes might lead to role modeling of a different sort by young people.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15e3 rs_skip" id="TJGV2KU6TPUHKCT2V151" clrenderdata="[&quot;MWNKKPAYBY34KU1XP053&quot;]" id-sequence="858"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf52-t3.jpg" data-width="1021" data-height="368"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf52-t2.jpg" data-width="595" data-height="212" data-alt="Babies learned more Chinese when listening to a person face to face than while watching the same person speak on a television monitor."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="LUHXKBA6G23LCBYTT082" id-sequence="859"><p>Babies learned more Chinese when listening to a person face to face than while watching the same person speak on a television monitor.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:595px;height:212px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_08_unf52-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Babies learned more Chinese when listening to a person face to face than while watching the same person speak on a television monitor." width="595" height="212" style="cursor: pointer;" class="rs_skip">			<div class="enlarge" style="left:585px">

Stumped by your new computer software, not to mention the manual that came with it, you watch as a tech-savvy friend shows you how to make it work. Young athletes pore over films of superstars to perfect their technique. Popular cooking shows on television teach you to prepare a special meal. Cross-generational cycles of domestic violence persist as children continue the patterns of aggressive behavior they observe in their parents and grandparents.

The adult yelled, “Pow, right in the nose!” when punching the doll in the face; “Sockeroo, stay down!” when hitting the doll with a mallet; “Fly away!” when kicking the doll around the room; and “Bang!” when throwing a ball at the doll. Subsequently, when the children were allowed an opportunity to play with a Bobo doll, they displayed a significant amount of aggression. In a later study, one group of children saw the adult being rewarded for aggression with candy and soda (<span class="citation" id="PMKMW5DJQSHTDAJDW080" id-sequence="879">Bandura, 1965</span>).

</div><div class="mediaCredit">Albert Bandura/Stanford University </div> </div></div></div> <p id="SHTSKRRSHQYG86JMG795" id-sequence="882">Bandura identified four necessary cognitive processes in the modeling of others’ behavior: attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Models that get our <em>attention</em> are more likely to elicit imitation. A person must <em>retain</em> a memory of what the model did. We must be able to <em>reproduce</em> the behavior. Many of us enjoy watching elite athletes perform, but no matter how long and often we watch Serena Williams or LeBron James, few of us have the talent to duplicate their movements. If you happen to play tennis or basketball, however, you can learn to improve your game if you carefully observe these superstars. Finally, a person must have a <em>motivation</em> for imitating the behavior. Either past or anticipated reinforcement encourages us to model another person’s behavior. In vicarious reinforcement, witnessing somebody else getting reinforced for a behavior raises the likelihood that we will imitate the behavior. At the same time, witnessing the other person getting punished for the behavior should reduce the likelihood that you will copy it.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="883"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="886"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="887" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="888" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="JLQA369PLM5D2XGZ9401" id-sequence="889"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">8-5b</span> <span class="headingText">Cultural Transmission of Learning</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="JBZKV72C8B21N41Z8571_content" id-sequence="890"> <p id="TVHZWTN3RM6EAQKTQ426" id-sequence="891">An individual’s learning may serve that person well throughout a lifetime, but the invention of culture provides opportunities to pass the benefits of experience along for many generations.

He referred to the basic unit of cultural transmission as a <em>meme</em>. Memes, he said, are transmitted by observational learning from one person to another and can take the form of ideas, symbols, or practices. Melodies, religious beliefs, catchphrases, and the technology for building arches are examples of memes. Dawkins viewed memes as the cultural equivalents of genes—they replicate from one person to the next and they respond to selection pressure. Memes that provide an advantage, such as knowledge of the use of fire, are likely to continue. Those that do not confer much advantage, such as some fads, are likely to die out quickly. Still others, such as pagers, are abandoned when more effective replacements (cell phones) emerge.</p> <p id="KFEYV52WYU82S1L9F636" id-sequence="896">Among the most social of memes are Internet memes, which are “inside jokes” passed to others using technologies such as social networking sites and e-mail.

It is easy to fall into the trap of feeling entitled to good behavior from the people who are close to us, which can lead to these behaviors being taken for granted and ignored. Without positive reinforcement, these good behaviors might be extinguished. It takes little time and energy to thank people for the nice things they do for us, and this simple courtesy can increase the frequency of positive interactions in the future.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15e8 rs_skip" id="HUEZEAMBYTHBKPAQM310" clrenderdata="[&quot;HKUNJQ8SE2SCB5R5S653&quot;]" id-sequence="906"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_unf57-t2.jpg" data-width="483" data-height="293" data-alt="Ignoring annoying behavior can be difficult, but you don’t want to reinforce it with attention."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="XWEYSPKB6RUXANVSN766" id-sequence="907"><p>Ignoring annoying behavior can be difficult, but you don’t want to reinforce it with attention.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:483px;height:293px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_08_unf57-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Ignoring annoying behavior can be difficult, but you don’t want to reinforce it with attention." width="483" height="293" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">prodakszyn/ <a target="_blank" id="KXTFEQ5T13VN97QW1437" name="KXTFEQ5T13VN97QW1437" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="908">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="PTHWH661WVDVXLK3M905" id-sequence="909">When undesirable behaviors inevitably occur, many people turn to punishment.

Punishing a partner for bad behavior might make<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_318" data-page="318"></a> you feel better, but this comes at a significant cost.

If possible, try to ignore negative behaviors, putting them on extinction. Unfortunately, some people would rather have negative attention from you than no attention and prefer punishment from you to being ignored. This is particularly likely to be the case if you have forgotten to reinforce positive behaviors. If you combine positive reinforcement of good behavior and extinction of negative behavior, you should notice quite an improvement.

To what extent can we use these principles to explain the occurrence of cyberbullying?</p> <p id="PTTL11X1BUPVHYTZV631" id-sequence="917">A study conducted with over 4,000 teens supported the idea that cyberbullying was influenced by observational learning (<span class="citation" id="HLZP10TFDJRQKXKTC822" id-sequence="918">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2013</span>). Having friends who also engaged in cyberbullying was a strong predictor of being a cyberbully (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ANWK7KWGA7E15XFNN769" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-section-id="JBZKV72C8B21N41Z8571" data-element-id="ANWK7KWGA7E15XFNN769">Figure 8.12</a>). A total of 62% of young people who indicated that “all” or “most” of their friends had cyberbullied in the previous six months admitted to cyberbullying themselves, in contrast to only 4% of the participants who had no friends who cyberbullied. Observing your friends engaging in cyberbullying might be similar to seeing Bandura’s adults assaulting the Bobo doll—the behavior is normalized. It is also possible, however, that “birds of a feather flock together,” or that antisocial teens tend to congregate in peer groups. Still, using the particular outlet of cyberbullying for antisocial tendencies requires the attention and exposure identified as important variables by Bandura.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf15e9 rs_skip" id="ANWK7KWGA7E15XFNN769" clrenderdata="[&quot;XUNCYJEWXF3UQNJAN541&quot;]" id-sequence="919"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_08_f12-t2.png" data-width="443" data-height="287" data-alt="A vertical bar graph is shown with a photo of a girl looking at her mobile, in the background.

Bandura argued that anticipated rewards and punishments influence the likelihood that we will copy a behavior. The teens who reported a strong likelihood of punishment from either their parents or school for cyberbullying were the least likely to engage in the practice, although this effect was smaller for the teens who associated with other bullies. Among the bullies, rewards related to peer acceptance might outweigh the negative sanctions from adults to some extent.</p> <p id="XNEV1A3Y4W80EPG5A196" id-sequence="923">Nonetheless, understanding the nature of the group support enjoyed by cyberbullies and the importance of anticipated sanctions can give schools and communities better tools for reducing cyberbullying.

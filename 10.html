Emotional knowledge increases when a person focuses on information relevant to the self rather than more general information.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:426px;height:337px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_11_f01-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A line graph shows the mean emotional knowledge scores of White Americans, Chinese, and Chinese immigrants at different ages.

Although we discuss each separately, they are constantly interacting. For example, moving independently by crawling or walking produces a more rapidly changing and interesting environment, which spurs an infant’s cognitive growth. At the same time, a mobile infant is likely to elicit different reactions from parents or caretakers than one who is stationary, stimulating further social and emotional development.</p> <p id="CRDFZ5ZVFG0T8T8LW299" id-sequence="53">In addition to documenting these three types of change over time, the study of development highlights several major questions that stretch across the entire life span.

Because younger children have had less time for epigenetic interactions between their genes and their experience to take place, they have more in common with one another at any particular age than do older adults, whose decades of experience have caused their epigenetic paths to lead them in many directions. A group of 8-year-olds is more consistent in its physical characteristics and behaviors than a group of 20-year-olds, who still have more in common with one another than any group of 65-year-olds. This contrast between children and adults might have led earlier psychologists to the mistaken belief that development “stopped” at some point in childhood or adolescence, when all they were seeing was a transition point where internal influences were becoming overshadowed by external ones.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="66"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="69"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="70" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="71" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="FPDMK1EBG4YCY9CG3672" id-sequence="72"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">11-1b</span> <span class="headingText">Continuity or Discontinuity</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="ZHSW19R0CV9MERKZQ900_content" id-sequence="73"> <p id="YEVRKY461ZDUHZEH6355" id-sequence="74">Another major question asks whether development proceeds gradually and smoothly over time (continuity) or changes more abruptly from one stage to the next (discontinuity).

Babies immediately turn their head to the source of a touch, open their mouth, and search for the mother’s nipple. This rooting reflex assists the newborn with the essential process of feeding. If an object is placed in the mouth, babies begin to suck reflexively, which also leads to effective feeding. Very young babies reflexively grasp any object placed in the hand, which leads to the later voluntary grasping of objects.

The appearance of the external genitalia is usually, but not always, consistent with genetic sex. In cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), an individual with male genetic sex (XY) cannot respond to circulating male hormones, leading to female external appearance. A very rare condition known as 5-alpha-reductase syndrome results in ambiguous genitalia at birth with later masculinization at puberty. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) exposes the fetus to excess male hormones, which has little effect on male sexual development but might masculinize the external genitalia of genetic females (Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="383"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="386"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="387" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="388" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="DZCSA0Y1JL6DRP7GY159" id-sequence="389"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">11-3d</span> <span class="headingText">The Newborn’s Senses</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="CHZXFTY9EB4BDNFE3478_content" id-sequence="390"> <p id="PFPDASKPQW7CX6WH6768" id-sequence="391">Newborns have significant, although immature, sensory capacities.

They apparently have a sweet tooth and nurse longer when their breast-feeding mother has consumed sweet-tasting foods (<span class="citation" id="AXVDT4RMFT32P2PU1288" id-sequence="398">Mennella &amp; Beauchamp, 1996</span>).</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_417" data-page="417"></a> <p id="CRDGE9TLGC0T9E0AZ407" id-sequence="399">The fetus can hear quite well beginning in gestational month seven, but improvement in hearing continues after birth. We might tiptoe around a sleeping newborn, but older children and adults have superior hearing for very quiet sounds. The infant’s ability to hear is best for sounds found in the range of frequencies that normally occur in human speech. This ability allows infants to learn language.</p> <p id="HPFGNAV7R351T5575543" id-sequence="400">Infant vision can be tested by measuring the amount of time the child spends viewing a pattern rather than a uniform screen. Using this technique, we can demonstrate that young infants do not see detail at a distance as well as adults do. In addition, infants need more contrast than adults to see well. As we discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-chapter-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-element-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599">Chapter 5</a>, contrast refers to differences in intensity between adjacent stimuli. The black letters on this white page are an example of high contrast, whereas dark gray letters on a black background would be an example of low contrast. These features of infant vision probably explain babies’ preference for large, high- contrast, colorful objects.</p> <p id="WSNEBNEUYT5Z983R8982" id-sequence="401">Newborns demonstrate an innate preference for looking at faces (<span class="citation" id="GMFCGWNMZ6NS7H43T040" id-sequence="402">Otsuka, 2014</span>) (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="NXFVRUANY46XUHBFR487" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-section-id="CHZXFTY9EB4BDNFE3478" data-element-id="NXFVRUANY46XUHBFR487">Figure 11.9</a>). This capacity sets the stage for further social behavior and language learning. We know that infants who refuse to make eye contact often develop social and language impairments later (Knickmeyer, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, &amp; Taylor, 2005; <span class="citation" id="VUCBAE3JVRSW69BN5662" id-sequence="403"> Mundy et al., 2007</span>).

The nervous system develops according to a “use it or lose it” principle, which emphasizes the important role of experience in wiring the brain. Children who are raised in a stimulating and enriched environment, with many things to explore, are likely to have the best outcomes. Children living in intellectually impoverished circumstances may retain too few connections, which may lead to mild forms of intellectual disability (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>).</p> <p id="SUXZ92T7UNL4X13H1039" id-sequence="502">Myelination, the growth in white matter that begins around gestational month six, continues to develop at a regular rate throughout childhood and adolescence (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="HVYDRHHQQ6CNNYJF4340" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-section-id="QRBFXJASXLD84TSRA408" data-element-id="HVYDRHHQQ6CNNYJF4340">Figure 11.12</a>) (<span class="citation" id="EEADYR10LX3BKYR14733" id-sequence="503">Houston, Herting, &amp; Sowell, 2013</span>).

Newborn humans’ mobility is handicapped by their<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_420" data-page="420"></a> proportions. One quarter of their length is made up by newborns’ heads. In contrast, adults’ heads make up approximately one-seventh to one-eighth of their height. Motor development, or change in our ability to move and perform physical skills, is largely driven by our human genetic blueprint. Identical twins typically reach motor milestones such as walking with more similar timing than that of fraternal twins or nontwin siblings (<span class="citation" id="KEGNBS7502D6PSLST221" id-sequence="517">Fox, Hershberger, &amp; Bouchard, 1996</span>). Because identical twins share more genes in common compared with fraternal twins, reaching milestones at the same time indicates an important role for genetics in early motor development.</p> <p id="FPAL3T5J4UJ4C9VNA029" id-sequence="518">Motor development in childhood proceeds simultaneously in two directions. First, we see development in the head-to-toe direction. Controlling the muscles of the neck and shoulders allows 2-month-old infants to raise their head to look around. This achievement is followed by development of the muscles of the torso around 3 months of age, which are necessary for rolling and sitting. Between 6 and 9 months, babies begin to crawl, although some happily skip this stage. Finally, around the first birthday, the muscles of the legs are developed sufficiently to support the weight of a child when standing or walking. Well into middle childhood, children continue to improve their movement and coordination, demonstrated by the abilities to skip rope, hop on one foot, and combine movements, such as throwing a ball while running (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="JNBHJFP4C00VBB5WR467" data-chapter-id="FWESRAGQVRBX40E4E415" data-section-id="LFWEN5YKEJNNEF56L108" data-element-id="JNBHJFP4C00VBB5WR467">Figure 11.13</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1699 rs_skip" id="JNBHJFP4C00VBB5WR467" clrenderdata="[&quot;QLBC6R7PRQRC3XAU3346&quot;]" id-sequence="519"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_11_f13-t3.png" data-width="866" data-height="388"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_11_f13-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="264" data-alt="An illustration shows various motor skills at different ages.

Cases of girls with CAH, who experience unusually high levels of prenatal exposure to male hormones also provide insight into toy choice.

A small number of children with unambiguous biological sex develop incongruent gender identity. Complex interactions among genetic, hormonal, cognitive, and psychosocial factors contribute to the development of a transgender identity. Follow-up studies suggest that earlier social transition to the experienced gender is the most reliable predictor of persistence with that gender in adulthood (Meyer-Bahlburg, 2013).</p> <div class="container dependent mt_diversevoicesinpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="TRTDRYEGTZJ1SKGSE542" label="diversevoicesinpsychology" id-sequence="557"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Diverse Voices in Psychology</span><h3 id="ZWDN5CZQW0Z67R08A623" id-sequence="558">What Are the Implications of Gender Assignment?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="TRTDRYEGTZJ1SKGSE542_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="559"> <p id="ZWPRQ8S0R7EQ5V00B567" id-sequence="560">The concept of gender has been transformed from a binary, categorical system (male or female) to more of a bimodal continuum (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-element-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587">Chapter 2</a>). This transition is evident in the legal codes of many nations, where official government documents such as passports now provide options other than male or female, and in the social media giant Facebook’s 58 choices for personal identifiers, plus unique identifiers that users choose for themselves.</p> <p id="NZEZ83K7X9ZDAD9QF132" id-sequence="561">Health care providers find no easy solutions within this environment when faced with cases of individuals with ambiguous physical features resulting from chromosome and hormonal influences. Gender assignment using the more traditional binary choices, in spite of passports and Facebook, remains a common goal within the medical community.</p> <p id="VTUCE221KVA7X205W893" id-sequence="562">One of the most contentious areas of gender assignment involves individuals born with ovotesticular syndrome (Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016). These individuals used to be referred to as “true hermaphrodites,” as they possess a gonad that contains both testicular tubular structures and ovarian follicles. Typically, about half of the newborns in this category are assigned to the female gender and the other half to the male gender, but clinicians do not necessarily agree on the criteria for making this judgment. Some are more influenced by the surgical challenges presented by an individual case while others consider fertility. As a result, many individuals with ovotesticular syndrome later develop gender dysphoria, a sense of mismatch between their assigned gender and their identities, and/or patient-initiated gender change.</p> <p id="CAUP1C35P1BG5C60F719" id-sequence="563">Perhaps the fluidity of the concept of gender will make gender assignment decisions on the part of the medical community simply unnecessary.

Even when children are exposed to the same information as adults, their thinking often leads them to different conclusions. When asked why clouds move across the sky, a 4-year-old might suggest that the clouds are pulled by airplanes, but an adult is unlikely to come to this conclusion. Both child and adult have observed clouds and airplanes moving across the sky, but viewing these occurrences as related is something that only a small child would do. To understand these differences, we need to examine how cognition changes as a function of age and experience.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf169e rs_skip" id="YWCJDMHQP32UPA3V3074" clrenderdata="[&quot;KBNYC5ZT3KX0MCPZE658&quot;]" id-sequence="575"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_11_unf19-t2.jpg" data-width="275" data-height="262" data-alt="A preschool child might believe that airplanes pull clouds across the sky, but an adult is unlikely to come to the same conclusion, even though they are watching the same events."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="VLUCZSNV7766K5NJ5413" id-sequence="576"><p>A preschool child might believe that airplanes pull clouds across the sky, but an adult is unlikely to come to the same conclusion, even though they are watching the same events.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:275px;height:262px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_11_unf19-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A preschool child might believe that airplanes pull clouds across the sky, but an adult is unlikely to come to the same conclusion, even though they are watching the same events." width="275" height="262" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Lindsey Parnaby/epa/Corbis Wire/Corbis </div> </div></div></div> <p id="VEBP6LHDW2H2EHHRY328" id-sequence="577">One of the classic theories about the development of cognition was proposed by Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). While working with Théodore Simon, who along with Alfred Binet developed some of the first intelligence tests (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>), Piaget became more interested in the errors made by the children than in their correct responses. He believed that these errors were representative of growth in the child’s ability to reason. Later, Piaget’s views were challenged and revised by psychologists who believed that he underestimated the capabilities of children at particular ages.

Sensations immediately evoke motor responses. As soon as they can crawl, infants work their way (usually quite rapidly) through the environment, exploring new objects by interacting with them physically, particularly by putting them in their mouths.

If Piaget covered his gold pocket watch with his beret while an infant watched, the infant would not show signs of searching for the now missing watch. Around the age of 8 months or so, infants become more persistent. If he hid the pocket watch, 8-month-olds would look for it.

</span>, which begins around the age of 12. The final piece to be added to the child’s cognitive skill set is the ability to handle abstract concepts. Abstract concepts usually involve “what if” types of questions and form the heart of scientific inquiry. If you were to ask a group of sixth graders what would happen if everyone on Earth became blind tomorrow, they would likely struggle to come up with a reasonable answer. A group of high school students, however, would readily reply that people who were already blind would become instant leaders because they would have existing skills for coping with blindness.</p> <p id="SUEK95NHT670C9GTN002" id-sequence="697">Accompanying the ability to think abstractly is a big improvement in problem solving. Younger children tend to approach problems by trying things out and seeing what happens, a rather inefficient trial-and-error approach. Teens are more likely to think through several alternatives more strategically. Abstract thinking ability also appears to stimulate a burst of idealism. What if we could solve world hunger? These are the types of questions teens begin to ask, and they are not always content with the more practical and less idealistic responses of older adults.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_427" data-page="427"></a> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="DSHDFNGWK1Q5WRDVH984" id-sequence="698"> <h3 id="WATCLVHA3SF5N24DH501" id-sequence="699"><span class="headingText">Criticisms of Jean Piaget’s Theory</span></h3> <p id="ZUSNDMXH06XP7V606012" id-sequence="700">Piaget’s classic theory set the standard for his time, but more contemporary developmental psychologists argue that some aspects of his view of cognitive development need updating and revising.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16a2 rs_skip" id="PPUL122K8X0QXDMVD635" clrenderdata="[&quot;TQJH3LV0U6L29F3U3943&quot;]" id-sequence="701"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_11_unf22-t2.jpg" data-width="455" data-height="268" data-alt="A photo shows three preteens, two boys and a girl playing with building blocks."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="TKAU9FH99SMG29YJU232" id-sequence="702"><p>One of Jean Piaget’s legacies to early childhood education is his emphasis on hands-on learning.

Other psychologists point out that individual cognitive development can be quite variable.

This variability makes cognitive development look more gradual and continuous than stagelike, as suggested by Piaget.</p> <p id="UNAB49ZU9ETPHUPBY331" id-sequence="704">Piaget did not specify mechanisms responsible for moving from one stage to the next.

We can identify behaviors in younger children that seem to act as building blocks leading to the achievement of TOM. Joint attention, which includes behaviors such as following another person’s gaze with one’s own and using pointing to direct another person’s attention to something in the environment, emerges in the first year of life (<span class="citation" id="BLATCY8054CHU84R6212" id-sequence="759">Barresi &amp; Moore, 1996</span>). The ability of young children to distinguish between living and nonliving objects is another important step in the development of TOM.

</span> between child and parent is not unique to humans. To identify behaviors leading to attachment between infants and their mothers, Harry Harlow (1905–1981) investigated attachment in rhesus monkeys (<span class="citation" id="FEHUZAMW8NX8ZL9WZ062" id-sequence="825">Harlow, 1958</span>). The Freudian theories still popular in Harlow’s day suggested that the pleasure obtained through feeding formed the basis of infants’ bond with their mothers. Behavioral approaches suggested that the infant was positively reinforced with food for staying near the mother. Harlow was not convinced by either of these arguments and set out to contrast the mother’s ability to provide food with her ability to provide comfort, security, and safety.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16a9 rs_skip" id="ZEYUPNYGZYL458F9V519" clrenderdata="[&quot;WLAA1GJ27NH5B4U3D269&quot;]" id-sequence="826"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_11_unf24-t2.jpg" data-width="248" data-height="353" data-alt="A photo shows man holding a baby monkey which is touching machine that looks like a monkey."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="XQLNMDT87EUQMHF9L735" id-sequence="827"><p>Harry Harlow (1905–1981) studied infant attachment by removing baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers at birth and providing them with a wire mother, such as the one shown here, and a similar mother covered with carpet. Regardless of which “mother” provided food, the infant monkeys spent more time cuddling with the cloth mother than the wire one. Harlow concluded that “contact comfort” provided by the mother was more important to attachment than the food she provided.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:248px;height:353px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_11_unf24-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows man holding a baby monkey which is touching machine that looks like a monkey." width="248" height="353" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Nina Leen/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <p id="NVKNBQ1K5YMBHY4SL768" id-sequence="828">After removing newborn rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers, Harlow presented the infants with two surrogate mothers, one made of wire and the other of cloth. Either surrogate could be rigged with a milk bottle, allowing Harlow to investigate all combinations of comfort and feeding. Regardless of which “mother” provided food, infant monkeys spent most of their time clinging to the cloth mother and ran to her immediately when threatened by a novel toy. The wire mothers were visited only if they provided food, and then for only as long as the infant was feeding. Based on his observations, Harlow concluded that the Freudian and behavioral emphasis on feeding was wrong. Instead, the mother’s ability to provide contact comfort was critical in forming a strong attachment on the part of her infant.</p> <p id="FPFE2YCC7BU90UECR702" id-sequence="829">A key factor in predicting the timing of attachment appears to be mobility. Young birds that are mobile upon hatching need to form immediate attachments to a protective adult.<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_433" data-page="433"></a> Human infants, who are not particularly mobile until the second half of their first year of life, have more time to bond with a caregiver. About the same time infants begin to crawl, usually between 6 and 8 months, they also begin to show evidence of having bonded with particular people in the form of separation anxiety (Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973/1999a, 1973/1999b). Before this stage, infants tolerate being handed around to admiring relatives and babysitters without much protest. Once children demonstrate stranger anxiety, however, they respond to unfamiliar people with crying and distress. Although stranger anxiety might be a nuisance for parents hiring a new sitter or an insult to visiting relatives, it is an important step forward in infants’ social development. The children recognize who does and, more importantly, who does not belong in their social world.</p> <p id="UXSYACSLGFYDZWR5D012" id-sequence="830">Several patterns of attachment between infant and caregiver were demonstrated in classic research by Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues (<span class="citation" id="WVGZX08GA3MJUE8J2845" id-sequence="831">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978</span>). Young children in a laboratory playroom were observed through a two-way mirror as their mothers or a friendly stranger left or entered the room.

</span>. Two of these, avoidant and anxious–ambivalent attachment, were identified by Ainsworth, and a fourth, disorganized attachment, was identified by other researchers (Main &amp; Solomon, 1986). Children with avoidant attachment did not react to their mother’s leaving with distress and allowed themselves to be comforted by the stranger. When the mother returned, the child with an avoidant attachment did not immediately approach her. Children who showed anxious–ambivalent attachment never seemed comfortable, even when their mother was present. Her leaving was greeted with great distress, and the child was alternately clingy and rejecting when she returned. Children with disorganized attachment seemed confused and not well attached. Such children showed contradictory behavior, such as approaching the mother walking backward.</p> <p id="HTVXTGB2K9L2DMDHJ451" id-sequence="839">Cultural influences on parenting behaviors influence attachment. Psychologists have compared the frequencies of the attachment types in the United States to frequencies in Japan and Germany (<span class="citation" id="ZPPXKKHPSZPFWEXGF850" id-sequence="840">Cole, 1999</span>). The Japanese sample had about the same proportion of securely attached infants as reported by Ainsworth but had higher proportions of anxious–ambivalent attachments and zero cases of avoidant attachment. In Germany, the number of anxious–ambivalent infants was about the same as in the United States, but many more had avoidant attachments. The exact features of each culture’s norms responsible for these differences remain to be explored.</p> <p id="PWNDX8ARQ08Y4ZM60651" id-sequence="841">What types of parenting behavior might foster secure attachment? When you are in public places, such as parks and malls, take a minute to watch parents interact with their children. Some parents are sensitive and responsive to their children’s needs (<span class="citation" id="SJLNV623FLM0P0FV8245" id-sequence="842">Cox, Owen, Henderson, &amp; Margand, 1992</span>). The responsive parents are teaching their children that the world is a predictable place in which their parents are there for them when needed. Consequently, these children feel free to explore their environment, knowing that if an emergency arises, they will be able to quickly and reliably obtain assistance from their parents. Small securely attached children have a relatively short radius of exploration, which lengthens gradually as they get older.</p> <p id="VBJW8TUP6M5AHLH2C459" id-sequence="843">In contrast, unresponsive or inconsistent parents are teaching their children that the world is an unpredictable place and that the parent may or may not be there for them when needed. In response to such insecure circumstances, children do not venture far from the parent. As suggested by the results of partial reinforcement experiments discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>, children with unresponsive or inconsistent parents make regular, frequent, and persistent demands for attention because they know that only a small subset of these demands will be met.

Secure attachment is a good model for relatively safe societies (<span class="citation" id="EFZPPP4ARUZTEC4LA639" id-sequence="848">Belsky, 1999</span>). In a safe society, parents have the time and resources to be attentive to children, and exploration is unlikely to put the children in danger. In contrast, secure attachments in dangerous societies might be maladaptive. If the environment is dangerous, parents have less opportunity to be responsive to their children, and exploration might put the children in great danger. The message that “The world is an unpredictable place in which we may or may not be able to help you, so stay close” might be more realistic under these circumstances.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="849"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="852"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="853" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="854" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="ZDRL9UJDWR9TTYK9F585" id-sequence="855"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">11-6c</span> <span class="headingText">Parenting Styles</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="LNQRXBFBQ3CHLH14X554_content" id-sequence="856"> <p id="AKZEV6DZUASVGJKL7501" id-sequence="857">Not all parents approach parenting the same way.

Females experience menarche (the first menstrual cycle), breast growth, maturity of the external genitalia, maturity of the uterus, and changes in fat distribution and quantity.

Gender identity refers to a person’s sense of being male or female. Sex-role behavior refers to a pattern of traditionally male or female behavior. As we discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapter 7</a>, sexual orientation refers to a stable pattern of attraction to people of a certain sex, independent of gender identity, sex-role behavior, and sexual experiences.</p> <p id="DAZV3S1TD3Z0DN8Q4303" id-sequence="990">Many complex variations in combinations of these variables occur. People with a homosexual orientation typically demonstrate a gender identity consistent with their biological sex, while showing the same range of variation in sex-role behaviors, from traditionally masculine to traditionally feminine, as people with a heterosexual orientation. Individuals with AIS, mentioned earlier in the chapter, typically develop female gender identity and sex-role behaviors in spite of their genetic male sex (XY). Girls with CAH, who are exposed to much higher levels of prenatal male hormones than typically developing girls, have higher rates of bisexual and lesbian sexual orientations. However, it’s important to note that the vast majority of bisexual and lesbian women do NOT have CAH, and that a substantial majority of women with CAH are heterosexual.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="UHKMF8Q2P0UDYJM3J534" id-sequence="991"> <h3 id="JMLNUM5QX970DGQ6V503" id-sequence="992"><span class="headingText">The Adolescent Brain</span></h3> <p id="PAQF8J3KMGFHPSAA3313" id-sequence="993">Early developmental psychologists, including Piaget, argued that cognition is rather mature at puberty, which in turn implies that the brain is mature. In some aspects, this conclusion is correct. By the teens, areas of the brain that process language, spatial relations, hearing, and other sensory processes appear complete. However, much additional work remains to be done before we can consider the brain to be fully adult. Far from considering the brain complete at puberty, today’s psychologists are viewing the early teen years as being a second critical period of brain growth, the first being prenatally up to age 18 months (<span class="citation" id="HPNV9Y6J5J6JQN2Y9082" id-sequence="994">Kuhn, 2008</span>).</p> <p id="YBNX6UFJJT1ATS15A275" id-sequence="995">The onset of puberty is accompanied by substantial gray matter growth, which peaks between the ages of 11 and 12 years (Semple, Blomgren, Gimlin, Ferriero, &amp; Noble-Haeusslein, 2013).

In general, we find that behaving in risky ways is more typical of teens, in spite of the fact that they perceive risk similarly to adults. How do psychologists know this? We can use instruments like the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale (<span class="citation" id="RJEU42ZDF3JF0H20D806" id-sequence="1005">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006</span>). To complete this scale, rate each of the 30 items twice: Once for how likely you would be to do the behavior (your risk-taking score) and then for how risky you think the behavior is (your risk-perception score). Once you have your responses, use the codes at the end of the box to divide your scores into the five domains: Ethical, financial, health/safety, recreational, and social. Add your scores for risk-taking and risk-perception for each domain. You might find that your behavior and perceptions are quite different from one domain to the next.</p> <div class="table rs_skip" id="MZAJBAUGMGNSSA9ZB825" id-sequence="1006"> <div class="maintable

Adults identify expressed emotions accurately, but teens frequently misunderstand the emotions being displayed. Brain imaging demonstrated that the amygdala, which provides a quick, subconscious assessment of emotion, showed the same pattern of activity in adults and teens. However, the adults showed more activity in the frontal lobes than the teens did, which might account for the adults’ superior judgment of emotional expression.</p> <p id="JDGEXQ9FKQRAYSXXP018" id-sequence="1137">The earlier maturation of the more emotional parts of the brain, including the amygdala, relative to the logical frontal lobes might account for some “risky” behaviors that characterize the teen years, such as reckless and drunk driving, driving without seatbelts, experimenting with drugs, and having unprotected sex. Risky behavior does not result from the teen’s inability to judge what is risky or not (Fischhoff, de Bruin, Parker, Millstein, &amp; Halpern-Felsher, 2010). Instead, teens typically believe that they are somehow immune from the consequences of risky behavior—for example, that drunk driving accidents happen to other people (<span class="citation" id="HAZRCJWERX3AVV5BW031" id-sequence="1138">Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006</span>).

In addition to forming traditional families that include two biological parents and their children, large numbers of people are choosing to remain single, live together without being married, be single parents, have children without being married, divorce, and remarry. Along with these changes, public attitudes regarding the question “What is a family?” continue to change.

Menstrual cycles may become irregular in a woman’s 40s as her sex hormone levels that regulate the cycles begin to drop. During the period of transition between the start of irregular periods and the final disappearance of menstruation, women can experience a number of physical and psychological symptoms. Hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, joint pain, mood swings, and sleep disturbances are common complaints, and the severity of these issues can range from barely noticeable to nearly disabling. Hormone treatments to offset these symptoms are used quite cautiously because they can also increase a woman’s risk of stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, and later dementia (<span class="citation" id="FZMUNYX6SZ33GJU7Z690" id-sequence="1405">Banks &amp; Canfell, 2009</span>).</p> <p id="HPZMJJ8TX5913GKLL382" id-sequence="1406">Men experience more gradual changes in their reproductive status through the remainder of their lives.

Recent economic and social changes have made midlife work less stable than it has been for previous generations. Today’s midlife workers express intent to stay employed longer than previous cohorts (at least until age 65), but some find themselves taking jobs below their levels of skill and experience or withdrawing from employment (<span class="citation" id="FZMJSY1XGL9U0J6TP480" id-sequence="1425">Elman, 2011</span>).</p> <p id="YLLQR4BC15FNYGBWF241" id-sequence="1426">During midlife, Erikson suggests that adults experience either generativity or stagnation. Many people, particularly during adolescence, set a number of goals for themselves. You may want to win a Nobel Prize or the Olympics or simply help others have a better life. Whatever your goals, by the time you reach midlife, you will have a good idea about whether these goals will be met. In many cases, people find that progress has been made toward their goals, although they perhaps didn’t meet them. Wherever an adult finds himself or herself at midlife, the question posed by Erikson is whether value exists. If people feel that their lives have had value, even if they fall short of their goals, they experience generativity. Adults experiencing stagnation, in contrast, have not found much satisfaction in their lives.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_449" data-page="449"></a> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1427"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1430"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1431" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1432" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="BTHFV75QSN7JBJD14814" id-sequence="1433"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">11-10</span> <span class="headingText">What Is Late Adulthood Like?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="TZMAQFAPGFXF8UBL8687_content" id-sequence="1434"> <p id="DDJZH6UED9RLRFLB6880" id-sequence="1435">As we have seen in our discussion of previous stages of development, the starting point of late adulthood is vague.

However, this decrease is not accompanied by dramatic cognitive and behavioral changes.

In contrast, when older adults are looking at a shorter period of remaining life, their goals are refocused toward seeking positive emotional experiences.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16c3 rs_skip" id="BSRFX5242QXMTFLEP114" clrenderdata="[&quot;AWGHPM2YUJR6G52DN349&quot;]" id-sequence="1497"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_11_f29.-t2.png" data-width="405" data-height="347" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the percentage of male and female of different age groups with major depressive disorder.

In married older adults, interacting with the spouse contributes to happiness by buffering the individual from stress (<span class="citation" id="JUCVY29U8LYEEW94Y906" id-sequence="1508">Waldinger &amp; Schulz, 2010</span>). Seniors who have remained married to the same person for decades have seen many changes in their relationships over the years. We observed earlier that parents of young children experience a drop in marital satisfaction, which improves as children leave the home as young adults. Long-term marriage partners show more similarities with each other because of a lifetime spent in each other’s company, along with a characteristic lack of attention to past negative events and personality traits (<span class="citation" id="APRVR7DUR4YGV8F90022" id-sequence="1509">O’Rourke &amp; Cappeliez, 2005</span>). In other words, they believe their relationship has been more positive than it was. These couples also show an interesting pattern of conflict avoidance, which contributes to higher levels of marital satisfaction.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_interpersonalrelationships narrative  rs_skip" id="LJWJAH4DGJMPFUPRP833" label="interpersonalrelationships" id-sequence="1510"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Interpersonal Relationships</span><h3 id="NURTQZSB3E0QUBXA3754" id-sequence="1511">The Developmental Perspective</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="LJWJAH4DGJMPFUPRP833_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1512"> <div class="pageSection" id="ARBWPZUZA7TQRVU3J060" id-sequence="1513"> <h3 id="WWMUCYT8RQJU64T8Z351" id-sequence="1514"><span class="headingText">How Do Age and Personality Interact to Predict Marital Satisfaction?</span></h3> <p id="ZYBF0M79717YZCDC6836" id-sequence="1515">Getting married and being married can mean different things at different stages in life. One of the more interesting age-related changes in marriage is the impact of similar personalities on a couple’s marital satisfaction throughout the life span (<span class="citation" id="MXTNLZPDAGWSRLDE8567" id-sequence="1516">Shiota &amp; Levenson, 2007</span>). Overall, the saying “Birds of a feather flock together” is quite true, so it is surprising that some similarities in personality are predictive of reduced marital satisfaction and are more so at some life stages than at others. Early in marriage, personality similarities can promote bonding and intimacy. At midlife, however, the focus of the couple often turns to more practical than romantic tasks, such as raising children, advancing careers, and running a household. In this new environment, similarities in the personality trait of conscientiousness are associated with less marital satisfaction (<span class="citation" id="XRZU6GFFMNNYJTSQS971" id-sequence="1517">Shiota &amp; Levenson, 2007</span>). The interaction between the highly conscientious person’s drive to finish tasks and the midlife tendency to be a bit less flexible in routine suggests that putting two such individuals under the same roof is likely to produce substantial conflict. We might also speculate that two nonconscientious partners might be overwhelmed by the midlife workload, and the stress resulting from constantly playing catch-up on tasks might take a toll on the relationship. Fortunately, as the family workload diminishes later in life, the married couple’s focus returns to intimacy, and the negative effects of similar personality recede again.</p> </div> </div></div> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_453" data-page="453"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologytakesonrealworldproblems narrative  rs_skip" id="WTWLZ1SV22W1WC55F220" label="psychologytakesonrealworldproblems" id-sequence="1518"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Psychology Takes on Real-World Problems</span><h3 id="CBWN22MQ9X81CHWUY361" id-sequence="1519">How Does Age Influence Cyberbullying?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="WTWLZ1SV22W1WC55F220_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1520"> <p id="BLDKMY8YTBUWJYJRC283" id-sequence="1521">We usually think of cyberbullying as something children and teens do, not necessarily something that older adults would do. As a result, we know relatively little about the prevalence and characteristics of cyberbullying by adults.</p> <p id="UVUJVXLTW2603HL7N757" id-sequence="1522">Christopher Bartlett and his colleagues (<span class="citation" id="PEUGNLDZQHKU1L115287" id-sequence="1523">Barlett &amp; Chamberlin, 2017</span>) surveyed 167 youth (average age of 13.76) and 552 adults (average age of 36.20) to attempt to fill this gap in our understanding of cyberbullying. Results indicated that cyberbullying does indeed occur in adulthood. In general, these researchers found that cyberbullying behavior increased into young adulthood and then decreased with further increases in age. The authors suggest several hypotheses for these findings. First, as we observed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>, cyberbullying is most prevalent among individuals who are relatively sophisticated in their use of the Internet and social media. Although the adult sample for this study was recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk, which implies a reasonable level of Internet competence among the participants, the age groups might have varied substantially in their online sophistication. Second, national law enforcement data cited by Bartlett et al. (2017) demonstrate that antisocial and aggressive crimes are more common in youth than in adults. We discussed several factors in this chapter, such as maturity of the parts of the brain that participate in decision-making, that might account for this finding. As cyberbullying qualifies as an aggressive behavior, we might expect it to follow the pattern of the crime statistics.</p> <p id="SQAGGEMS5JY63F9HX049" id-sequence="1524">Many further questions about adult cyberbullying remain.

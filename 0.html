Hundreds of years ago, people believed that the world was flat and the Sun and stars circled the Earth. Careful scientific research slowly dispelled these inaccurate notions. Nonetheless, we hold tightly to many equally false commonsense beliefs about the human mind and behavior. We all “know” that opposites attract, but we also “know” that birds of a feather flock together—so why do we need psychology to tell us what we already “know”? The problem is that both statements cannot be true at the same time, so the real state of affairs is neither obvious nor simple. Just as careful science was required to understand our planet’s place in the universe, the same scientific techniques are providing us with a more accurate, complete view of the human mind.</p> <p id="RHFWH2Z2KQX2KU74F183" id-sequence="30">Let’s begin with a seemingly simple and familiar example: our ability to taste. We know a lot about taste—what we like or dislike, the different qualities of taste, and so on. Most of us can taste sweetness in a solution made of 1 part sugar and 200 parts water. As remarkable as this sensitivity appears to be, however, people can detect 1 part bitter substance (like quinine or the chemicals in broccoli) in 2 million parts water. This contrast in taste sensitivity between sweet and bitter does not reflect the actual difference between sweet and bitter substances—that is, bitter tastes are not 10,000 times stronger than sweet tastes—but rather how we experience them. Why would we have such a vast difference in sensitivity between these types of tastes?</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13bf rs_skip" id="ERAEM0YQX2Q8TLFA9529" clrenderdata="[&quot;LDRVNC26SREVC3DEX240&quot;]" id-sequence="31"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf01-t2.jpg" data-width="293" data-height="253" data-alt="A photo shows a boy holding a broccoli with a skeptical expression."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:293px;height:253px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_01_unf01-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows a boy holding a broccoli with a skeptical expression." width="293" height="253" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Masterfile/Masterfile </div> </div></div></div> <p id="FQEZ8FPJ16KT3FJ0J560" id-sequence="32">Our personal experience of taste does not help us much in answering this question, but psychological science can.

Being far more sensitive to tastes that are bitter is a trait that has served our species well because it helps us avoid eating things that could kill us.

One can think of this like the zoom feature in Google Earth. In some parts of this textbook, we will zoom in on human behaviors, like looking at the highly magnified image of the papillae on the tongue (pictured on page 2), which allow us to taste, and trace the messages about taste sent from the tongue to the brain. At other times, we’ll zoom out, to take in the larger picture and better understand why the boy on the previous page is giving his bitter-tasting broccoli a skeptical look.</p> <p id="CVMXH0TRFME5U56HB945" id-sequence="36">Psychologists approach the study of mind using various in-depth perspectives, which will be described in this chapter. For example, we can look at the little boy’s reaction to his broccoli from a developmental perspective, which tells us that taste sensitivity decreases over the life span. Using a biological perspective, we can determine the neural mechanisms responsible for the difference in taste sensitivity. Or, using the social perspective, we can think about social influences like culture on food preferences. Cottage cheese, enjoyed by many Americans, is viewed with disgust in some other parts of the world. Meanwhile, fruit bat pie, a delicacy in Palau, might not be a popular item in the United States.</p> <p id="FRTEYNNRJQGA3DNJD188" id-sequence="37">Although single perspectives can tell us a lot about a phenomenon like our sensitivity to bitter tastes, no one perspective can give us a complete answer. The best view comes from putting multiple perspectives together. You can learn a lot about your house by zooming in on it in Google Earth, but when you see how your home fits into the larger context of city, state, country, and planet, that viewpoint adds something special to your understanding.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13c1 rs_skip" id="PPBTLYUMP594LGEHN588" clrenderdata="[&quot;VZPT9AY9RULCN74AQ273&quot;]" id-sequence="38"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf03-t2.jpg" data-width="505" data-height="399" data-alt="The Science of Mind"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:505px;height:399px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_01_unf03-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="The Science of Mind" width="505" height="399" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit"><a target="_blank" id="MAKH49SYJB2QDGC91978" name="MAKH49SYJB2QDGC91978" class="external" href="http://iStockphoto.com" id-sequence="39">iStockphoto.com</a>/NASA/kutay tanir </div> </div></div></div> <p id="AJPPUTDWL1D6QE0M9886" id-sequence="40">We’ll start by learning more about psychology’s main perspectives, along with a little background about their origins.

</span> is as fascinating as it is complex. Psychological scientists view the mind as a way of talking about the activities of the brain, including thought, emotion, and behavior. A quick look at this textbook’s table of contents will show you the variety of approaches to <em>mind</em> that you will encounter, such as the thinking mind (cognitive psychology) and the troubled mind (abnormal psychology).</p> <p id="TCZS6UTXDSM27G5LG299" id-sequence="52">The word <em>psychology</em> is a combination of two Greek words: <em>psyche</em> (or <em>psuche</em>), or “soul,” and <em>logos</em>, meaning “the objective study of.” For the ancient Greeks, a soul was close to our modern view of a spirit or mind. <em>Logos</em> is the source of all our “ologies,” such as biology and anthropology.

</span> means “the objective study of the mind.” Contemporary definitions of psychology refine and update this basic meaning. Today’s psychologists define their field as the scientific study of behavior, mental processes, and brain functions—that is, the scientific study of the mind. Increased recognition that the brain is the organ of the mind has led many psychology departments to expand their names to the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (or the equivalent).</p> <p id="WLWW47FQ3PZQNHGE6756" id-sequence="55">The phrase “behavior, mental processes, and brain functions” has undergone several changes over the history of psychology. <em>Behavior</em> refers to any action that we can observe.

Our definition does not specify whose behavior is to be examined.

</span>, or the personal observation of your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Because it is difficult for others to confirm your introspections, this subjective approach does not lend itself well to the scientific method. If you say that you are feeling hungry, how can anyone else know whether your observation is accurate? In addition, your mind and behavior are governed by a host of structures, factors and processes, most of which are not available through introspection. Innovations in the methods and mathematics used to investigate brain activity and behavior have allowed psychologists to revisit the question of mental processes and brain functions with greater objectivity and success.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologyasahubscience narrative  rs_skip" id="VFGUPGCSQXQD75P7M907" label="psychologyasahubscience" id-sequence="59"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label">Psychology as a Hub Science</span><h3 id="DHBZ2THHM7WNBGKM8181" id-sequence="60">Why Is Psychology a Hub Science?</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="VFGUPGCSQXQD75P7M907_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="61"> <p id="FQNX7SQ813T7W160H847" id-sequence="62">Most readers of this book are not pursuing careers in psychology, so how will this material help you in your chosen career? Psychology is all about people, and nearly all occupations require an understanding of people and their behavior. An architect cannot design a functional space without considering how people respond to being crowded. An attorney cannot cross-examine a witness without an understanding of memory, motivation, emotion, and stress. A teacher cannot encourage students to reach their potential without an understanding of child development and learning. Business leaders and economists cannot predict the movements of markets without understanding the minds making the relevant decisions. The study of psychology, then, provides you with better insight into and understanding of many occupations and fields of study.</p> <p id="WYGCP17XUGKB3NXLE479" id-sequence="63">You probably have seen applications that allow you to map your friendship networks on social media, with shorter links indicating greater connectivity and larger bubbles indicating more overlapping friendships with another person.

The resulting map shows the extent to which each of the sciences are influential and what other sciences they most influence. Boyack and colleagues referred to the most influential sciences as hub sciences. Their analysis shows that psychology is one of the seven major hub sciences, with strong connections to the medical sciences, the social sciences, and education. In the upcoming chapters of this book, we will highlight these connections with examples that are relevant to each particular chapter.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13c2 rs_skip" id="KHLS8P154YZ3Q69S6105" clrenderdata="[&quot;CVGBLXJWULPQ8EUZ6487&quot;]" id-sequence="64"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_f01-t2.png" data-width="227" data-height="227" data-alt="Psychology as a Hub Science."></div><div class="nb_media image"><div class="mediaTitle" id="SWJDBYDHSQE9EG6LU487" id-sequence="65"><span class="mediaFigureLabel"><span class="mediaLabelText">Figure </span><span class="mediaFigureNumber">1.1</span></span><span class="mediaAssetTitle">Psychology as a Hub Science.</span></div><div class="mediaDescription" id="YKZGD5F18GTJM9Q9S550" id-sequence="66"><p>This map of science was generated by comparing citations from more than 1 million papers published in more than 7,000 journals since 2000.

For example, they demonstrated that a single sensory nerve carried one type of information instead of multiple types. You might have already duplicated this research yourself while rubbing your sleepy eyes—you see a flash of light. The nerves serving the retina of the eye do not know how to process information about touch or pressure. When stimulated, they are capable of only one type of message—light. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) asked his participants to push a button when they felt a touch. When a thigh was touched, participants reacted faster than when a toe was touched.

The gradual merger of these approaches resulted in a series of experiments that looked increasingly like contemporary psychology. Scientists began to ask questions about the relationships between physical stimulation and its resulting sensations. For example, Gustav Fechner (1801–1889) was able to<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_7" data-page="7"></a> identify the softest sound that a person could hear by randomly presenting sounds of different intensities to which a participant would respond “yes” or “no.” When the “yes” responses reached 50%, Fechner concluded that the sound was within the range that the human ear could detect (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-chapter-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599" data-element-id="MHBJUR6JN6H15AF1Q599">Chapter 5</a>). Although Fechner’s research seems very similar to Helmholtz’s, note the importance of “mental processes” in Fechner’s work, as opposed to the simple measurement of physiology in Helmholtz’s experiment. The stage was set for a modern science of psychology.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13c7 rs_skip" id="PPHRUKNDWW8C1GWYZ206" clrenderdata="[&quot;QRFDB3R23UEJLEQRW350&quot;]" id-sequence="122"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf06-t2.jpg" data-width="275" data-height="270" data-alt="The work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) on reaction time helped establish the mind as something that could be studied scientifically."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="HCAYAV22ZS8TZ9G7G832" id-sequence="123"><p>The work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) on reaction time helped establish the mind as something that could be studied scientifically.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:275px;height:270px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_01_unf06-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="The work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) on reaction time helped establish the mind as something that could be studied scientifically." width="275" height="270" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">bilwissedition Ltd. &amp; Co.

For example, he coined the term <em>stream of consciousness</em> to describe the flow of ideas that people experience while awake.

According to this view, psychological disorders resulted from the actions of evil spirits or other external, magical forces. Between the 17th and the 19th centuries, supernatural explanations for psychological disorders began to give way to two scientific approaches: a medical model and a psychological model. The medical model of psychological disorder emphasized physical causes of abnormal behavior and medical treatments, such as medication. The psychological model suggested that abnormal behavior can result from life experiences, leading to fear, anxiety, and other counterproductive emotional responses. Psychological treatments take many forms, from offering support to applying cognitive and behavioral methods to help people think and problem-solve in new<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_12" data-page="12"></a> ways.

For example, we know that feeling depressed has both physical components (changes in the activity of chemical messengers in the brain) and experiential components (exposure to stressful situations).

His psychodynamic theory and its applications to the treatment of psychological disorders dominated much of psychological thinking for the first half of the 20th century. Freud’s ideas about the existence of the unconscious mind, the development of sexuality, dream analysis, and psychological roots of abnormal behavior influenced not just psychology, but also culture.

Structuralism had fallen into disfavor, and functionalism and Gestalt psychology were no longer distinct schools of thought. Just as other aspects of American culture at this time began to feature rebelliousness against current ways of thinking, some psychologists began to push against the restrictions of psychodynamic theory. Many of these disenchanted psychologists had been trained in psychoanalysis but were not seeing the results they desired. This dissatisfaction with prevailing views led these psychologists to propose new ways of thinking about the human mind through an approach known as <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0df5" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0df5"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0df5" id="LGSL5AJ8KEVTCN1HR139" id-sequence="350"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">humanistic psychology</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="NZTQWJTLPH3GQEMEQ670" id-sequence="351">humanistic psychology</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">An approach that saw people as inherently good and motivated to learn and improve.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0df5">

Humanistic approaches to therapy have also influenced communication, group process, parenting, and politics. The emphasis on active listening and the use of “I hear what you’re saying” reflections have become nearly cliché in courses of leadership training and interpersonal communication.

While studying digestion in dogs, he realized that the dogs’ salivation in response to the arrival of the handler or to being harnessed for an experiment, rather than just to the food itself, indicated that the dogs had associated, or linked, these signals with the arrival of food. The dogs’ ability to use this learned association to anticipate important future events was a remarkable advantage in terms of survival.

Although classical conditioning occurs in rather primitive organisms, including fruit flies, snails, and slugs, it also occurs quite frequently in humans. Many of our emotional responses associated with environmental cues are the result of this type of learning. If you feel especially anxious prior to taking an exam, you can thank classical conditioning. If you are repulsed by the idea of eating a food that you once consumed just before becoming ill, this is again a likely result of classical conditioning.</p> <p id="TYUNGJGHVUH9AW87A228" id-sequence="374">John B. Watson (1878–1958) began experimenting with learning in rats and independently came to many of the same conclusions as Pavlov. Watson echoed the blank-slate approach of the British empiricist philosophers in his emphasis on the role of experience in forming human behavior. Later in his career, Watson applied his understanding of behavior to the budding American advertising industry. By 1930, he was earning $70,000 per year as an advertising executive—an astronomical salary for the time, much higher than the $3,000 per year he earned as a professor. After discovering that blindfolded participants couldn’t tell the difference between brands of cigarettes, Watson concluded that to be successful,<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_15" data-page="15"></a> a product must be associated with an appealing image.

Other behaviorists were more interested in the effects of consequences on behavior, an idea that was derived from basic functionalism. Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) proposed the <em>law of effect</em>, which suggested that behaviors followed by pleasant or helpful outcomes would be more likely to occur in the future, whereas behaviors followed by unpleasant or harmful outcomes would be less likely to occur. He based his law on observations of cats’ behavior in a puzzle box he had constructed (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="DBAAU6DAQ6ZZY8VT5103" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-section-id="SWTAFYA8YTL0DT820429" data-element-id="DBAAU6DAQ6ZZY8VT5103">Figure 1.5</a>). To escape the box, a cat was required to complete a sequence of behaviors. Through trial-and-error learning, the cat would escape faster and faster on successive trials. In other words, the cat repeated effective behaviors and abandoned ineffective ones.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13da rs_skip" id="DBAAU6DAQ6ZZY8VT5103" clrenderdata="[&quot;DHHRDMV84Y4QHVPSB599&quot;]" id-sequence="381"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_f05-t2.png" data-width="578" data-height="422" data-alt="A graph shows the time required to escape as the number of trials increases, accompanied by an illustration of a cat pressing a lever in Thorndike’s box.

F. Skinner (1904–1990) was interested in the effects of consequences on how frequently behaviors were performed. Skinner shared Watson’s belief that psychology did not benefit from consideration of consciousness or internal mental states (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="YAXD787A3EVHJRE2P041" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-section-id="SWTAFYA8YTL0DT820429" data-element-id="YAXD787A3EVHJRE2P041">Figure 1.6</a>). He believed that inner, private states such as thinking and feeling existed, but he viewed them as behaviors that followed the same rules as public behaviors, like driving a car (<span class="citation" id="WPCF2EFNUDM3SBKLP140" id-sequence="385">Jensen &amp; Burgess, 1997</span>). He not only reduced his study of behavior to the actions of rats and pigeons in adapted cages that came to be known as <em>Skinner boxes</em>, but he also was comfortable generalizing from the behavior of rats and pigeons to complex human behaviors. Despite its strong focus on a limited set of animals and situations, Skinner’s behaviorism has provided a wealth of beneficial applications. Smokers attempting to quit, doctors and nurses engaging in self-paced continuing education courses, and children receiving treatment for autism spectrum disorder are all likely to be benefiting from Skinner’s efforts.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13db rs_skip" id="YAXD787A3EVHJRE2P041" clrenderdata="[&quot;BKQW7QQWG41W6P6GG456&quot;]" id-sequence="386"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_f06-t2.png" data-width="444" data-height="366" data-alt="An illustration shows input, stimulus, passing through a black box or a brain, resulting in the output, response."></div><div class="nb_media image"><div class="mediaTitle" id="BZBMEV66C31304BQV673" id-sequence="387"><span class="mediaFigureLabel"><span class="mediaLabelText">Figure </span><span class="mediaFigureNumber">1.6</span></span><span class="mediaAssetTitle">Behaviorism Set the Stage for Behavioral Neuroscience.</span></div><div class="mediaDescription" id="NUJEKYCLX9D8420N4109" id-sequence="388"><p>Strict behaviorists often referred to a “black box” model, in which stimuli enter and responses exit, but you don’t need to know much about what the box is doing to the data.

the behaviorists all tried to answer psychological questions with a comprehensive “big theory” approach. However, it is difficult to build a big theory without a large body of experimental data, and psychology was still a young science. To fill this gap, psychological scientists began to build a database by specializing in more specific points of view, or perspectives. By focusing on one part of the discipline, as opposed to trying to answer everything at once, psychologists began to gain an in-depth understanding of at least one aspect of mind at a time.</p> <p id="QYLE7Q8MRYGQ5DH12566" id-sequence="482">By the second half of the 20th century, most psychologists were examining psychological phenomena from one of a handful of perspectives. The use of different perspectives does not imply disagreement or conflict. In most cases, the use of each perspective depended on specialized expertise and methods, so different fields of psychology became characterized by their distinct theories and methods. For example, understanding how a child learns a new vocabulary word would be investigated using different theories and methods by the biological, developmental, cognitive, social, or behavioral psychologist.</p> <p id="AQAWUQUWT8PP4TXKD830" id-sequence="483">Reflecting the traditional divisions of the field, it is common today for psychologists to refer to themselves as “social psychologists,” “developmental psychologists,” and so on, indicating their area of specialization and interest. Psychology departments of universities often continue this organization, and students applying to graduate school in psychology might specialize in one particular area, like choosing an undergraduate major.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13ea rs_skip" id="YAZH47AQXNT6B90HM777" clrenderdata="[&quot;UTHEXPRGGURC0Q0BR374&quot;]" id-sequence="484"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf38-t2.jpg" data-width="376" data-height="252" data-alt="A photo shows Scott Grafton pointing at the brain scans on a screen."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="MANVYNKBW4YZ0JWB9030" id-sequence="485"><p>Biological psychologists explore the relationships among mind, behavior, and their underlying biological processes.

This perspective should sound familiar—it is a modern extension of James’s functionalism, discussed previously in this chapter. Earlier, we also saw evolutionary psychology at work in the shaping of our sensitivity to bitter tastes. The basic principle of evolutionary psychology is that our current behavior exists in its present form because it provided some advantage in survival and reproduction to our ancestors. An<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_21" data-page="21"></a> evolutionary psychologist might be interested in our good memory for faces, and particularly for faces of people who have cheated us in the past (Barclay &amp; Lalumière, 2006).

Because our ability to remember plays an integral part in the processing of information, a cognitive psychologist is likely to have a lot to say about the storage and retrieval of memories. A cognitive psychologist might ask why processing seems different when we are trying to remember names and dates while taking a history test compared to remembering how to ride a bicycle. What processes lead to the frustrating experience of having something on the “tip of your tongue,” in which you remember the first letter or a part of a word you’re trying to retrieve, but not the whole thing?

Without further practice, 3-month-old babies can retain for about a month the memory that kicking moves a mobile suspended above their crib (Rovee-Collier, 1997).

Social and personality psychologists recognize that we construct our own realities and that the social environment influences our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Early psychologists were limited in their understanding of mind by their exclusive focus on their own sociocultural contexts. More recently, social psychologists have emphasized the need to explore the influences of sociocultural context and biology on our behavior. Returning to our memory example, the social psychologist might ask how being in the presence of others influences the storage and retrieval of data. When we are sitting comfortably in our own homes, the answers to <em>Jeopardy!</em> questions come relatively easily.

Armed with in-depth research results compiled from these various perspectives, many psychological scientists in the 21st century have returned to the more comprehensive view of the mind envisioned more than 100 years ago by James (<span class="citation" id="PEKDGUJ3NRGRJMJXA718" id-sequence="536">Cacioppo, 2013</span>).

The guidelines proposed for the introductory psychology course by Gurung et al. (2014) emphasize the need to use culture and diversity as a “cross-cutting theme.” In accordance with this view, each of the editions of this textbook has been crafted following the guidance provided by Trimble, Stevenson, and Worell (2003) about integrating issues of diversity into all relevant discussions in an organic way.</p> <p id="HFSCY2ZLKR7SJTZ48660" id-sequence="545">In addition to incorporating diversity seamlessly throughout our topics, we also believe that it is useful to provide opportunities to highlight diversity issues in greater depth, which is the purpose of having this feature in each chapter. As suggested by Betancourt and López (1993, p. 636), “psychology as a discipline will benefit both from efforts to infuse culture in mainstream research and theory and from efforts to study culture and develop theory in cross-cultural and ethnic psychology.”</p> <p id="PTBFPA9BGR9D3QJG3507" id-sequence="546">This first chapter has reviewed psychology’s historical timeline and explored some of the career paths that psychologists can follow. From a diversity perspective, we see that the history of psychology features a dramatic underrepresentation of ethnic and racial minorities and a very short timeline. Stanley <span class="citation" id="VNUJTUU4YQKPKGCPA233" id-sequence="547"> Sue (2009)</span> noted that it wasn’t until 1975 that the first African-American woman was licensed as a psychologist (Gail Wyatt) in the state of California. Sue himself was told that in 1971, he was the only Chinese-American with a regular faculty appointment in an American Psychological Association–accredited clinical psychology program in the entire nation. As Sue and others have pointed out, underrepresentation has negative consequences both for psychologists themselves and for the people they serve as teachers, researchers, or therapists. Recognition of the problem has led to remedial efforts, but there is still a long way to go.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13f1 rs_skip" id="FZEUEJJAR6F6UBX8A057" clrenderdata="[&quot;EEWRBWH5HDVPQZ7MC263&quot;]" id-sequence="548"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf43-t2.jpg" data-width="295" data-height="414" data-alt="A photo shows a doll with a white head."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="NJPXT3HJWNUM88RQU278" id-sequence="549"><p>Kenneth and Mamie Clark conducted some of the most famous experiments in psychology in 1939–1940.

The Clarks not only made Contributions to our understanding of the social context of child development, but their research was applied as evidence in hearings by the U.S. Supreme Court on the detrimental effects of segregated schools.

However, we strongly believe that this future will involve combining and integrating new and existing perspectives. Many of these new ways of looking at the mind will take advantage of the revolution in techniques for studying the brain that began in the 1970s and continues. Already, today’s cognitive neuroscientists investigate the brain as an information-processing system and search for the biological basis of topics such as attention, decision making, and memory. Social neuroscientists investigate the biological factors that vary with people’s feelings and experiences of social inclusion, rejection, or loneliness. Behavioral neuroscientists pick up previous lines of research on learning, memory, motivation, and sleep, and search for connections between these processes and our biology. Clinical and counseling psychologists are likely to consider biological processes in their theories about the causes of psychological disorders.

For many years, researchers were puzzled in their efforts to understand the relationships between child maltreatment and later antisocial behavior. Although maltreatment often seems to be linked to later criminal behavior, the majority of maltreated children do not become delinquents or adult criminals (<span class="citation" id="BJNT7JLRPZZS4T7M0149" id-sequence="563">Caspi et al., 2002</span>).</p> <p id="ZKEE1C206DLV6DZWJ311" id-sequence="564">To solve this dilemma, a clinical psychologist might focus on environmental factors, such as the presence of a trusted adult or delinquent peer group, or personal factors, like resilience. Working in parallel, biological psychologists know something about certain candidate genes and their relationships with aggressive behavior in animals. In particular, animals with a low-activity version of the <em>MAOA</em> gene seemed to be more aggressive than animals with a higher-activity version. However, links between variations in <em>MAOA</em> and human aggression are not clear.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13f4 rs_skip" id="BFUKKH80P0VC0E717699" clrenderdata="[&quot;FVUPYAAAPC63W2EPV030&quot;]" id-sequence="565"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf46-t2.jpg" data-width="299" data-height="183" data-alt="Experiencing childhood maltreatment does not reliably predict aggressiveness in youth, but combining genetics and exposure to maltreatment provides a clearer picture."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="BXBL6W2V01D9GHVDC387" id-sequence="566"><p>Experiencing childhood maltreatment does not reliably predict aggressiveness in youth, but combining genetics and exposure to maltreatment provides a clearer picture.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:299px;height:183px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_01_unf46-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Experiencing childhood maltreatment does not reliably predict aggressiveness in youth, but combining genetics and exposure to maltreatment provides a clearer picture." width="299" height="183" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">DNA Strand: Science Picture Co/Superstock; Teenager: Suzanne Tucker/Shutterstock.com </div> </div></div></div> <p id="LAPBXVGQ46W1YP2XQ478" id-sequence="567">Separately, neither group of psychologists is likely to do a very good job of explaining why some children exposed to maltreatment engage in antisocial behavior while others do not.

It appears that a gene-environment interaction takes place, in which children with the low-activity version of the <em>MAOA</em> gene responded to maltreatment by becoming antisocial, while children with the higher-activity version do not (<span class="citation" id="PDAVJ5WN1WU9C9VM0085" id-sequence="568">Caspi et al., 2002</span>; <span class="citation" id="GCLKA4PG6T2861HLG515" id-sequence="569"> Fergusson, Boden, Horwood, Miller, &amp; Kennedy, 2011</span>).

Calling oneself a psychologist is restricted to holders of graduate (usually doctorate) degrees. This does not mean that students who completed a bachelor’s degree in psychology cannot be employed in relevant fields. Some people with undergraduate degrees in psychology prefer employment in fields that are directly related to psychology, such as working in research facilities or rehabilitation centers for drug abuse or brain damage. Others are quite successful in a variety of people-oriented jobs, such as those found in management, sales, customer service, public affairs, education, human resources, probation, and journalism. This diversity of career pathways reflects the hub nature of psychology to other fields, as described earlier in this chapter.</p> <p id="KDZCS1GXJ0DYUVQM5348" id-sequence="583">More than half of people holding graduate degrees in psychology work in health care, counseling, financial services, or legal services professions (Stamm, Lin, &amp; Christidis, 2016).

Choosing a graduate perspective is similar to choosing an undergraduate major. Although all psychology graduate students might take core courses in research methods and statistics, they typically pursue coursework and research in their particular area of specialization. However, training of psychologists in the 21st century is beginning to reflect the connections occurring in the field. Increasingly, students are being trained in combined specialties (e.g., cognitive neuroscience) as psychology becomes an increasingly integrated field of study.</p> <p id="XHRP1MZY1UHD3H9F1591" id-sequence="592">The most rigid distinction occurs between graduate students who plan to specialize in clinical or counseling psychology and those who do not. The clinical or counseling track includes extensive internships and supervised training prior to government-regulated licensure that usually add at least 1 year to students’ graduate studies. Do not assume that your psychology professors are all therapists; it is most likely they are not. It is important to distinguish between therapists with doctoral degrees in psychology (PhDs or PsyDs) and psychiatrists, who are medical doctors (MDs). The biggest difference between the two professions is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication, but psychologists usually cannot. In New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho however, specially trained psychologists can legally prescribe medications, and this trend might spread to other states.

As such, psychology has much to say about the causes and solutions of contemporary human problems. To illustrate psychology’s power to contribute to the understanding and solution of these problems, each chapter will focus on a “big problem” from the point of view of the chapter content. While each chapter addresses only a part of the problem, by the time you reach the end of the textbook, you will have been exposed to many ways that psychology can contribute to solving some of the biggest challenges that human beings face today, such as pollution, climate change, education, poverty, terrorism, pandemics, food insecurity, crime, and social injustice.</p> <p id="TBHAJZ0BPEP42R4ND254" id-sequence="606">Solving such big problems might seem overwhelming, but by breaking each problem into little steps, real progress can be made. We’d like to model this process for you by tackling a single problem, but we encourage you to expand on our model by applying what you’ve learned to other issues that you find important. The problem we’ll address is <em>cyberbullying</em>, or the use of electronic technology to bully another person. <em>Bullying</em>, in turn, is defined as aggressive, repeated behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2015, nearly one out of every six high school students experienced cyberbullying in the previous 12 months (<span class="citation" id="QVGYKPVAS08R486SC212" id-sequence="607">Kann et al., 2016</span>). Outcomes for the individuals involved included depression, anxiety, health problems, academic problems, and even suicide.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf13f9 rs_skip" id="MKFGJWFUEZRF0BJE1126" clrenderdata="[&quot;NDWKAA084T85P57ZW581&quot;]" id-sequence="608"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_01_unf50-t2.jpg" data-width="249" data-height="351" data-alt="What Does It Mean to Be a Psychologist?"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:249px;height:351px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_01_unf50-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="What Does It Mean to Be a Psychologist?" width="249" height="351" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Blend Images/Blend Images/ <a target="_blank" id="UUGRE99MQ94YA0USF040" name="UUGRE99MQ94YA0USF040" class="external" href="http://Superstock.com" id-sequence="609">Superstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <p id="RYLPJUAXTZ3R0PDSM273" id-sequence="610">In the upcoming chapters, we want you to think about how the different perspectives might view both the causes and solutions to our problem.

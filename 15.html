Zooming in, we look at one of her adrenal glands, shown in the larger image. Your adrenal glands are located on top of your kidneys in your lower back, and they are the source of hormones that are dumped into your bloodstream at times of stress. How does feeling stressed get translated into activity by a gland?</p> <p id="WTHE4LBGXCXU7W14V897" id-sequence="32">Here is how the system works. First, the woman must identify something as a threat to her. Making that cognitive appraisal, or judgment, of her situation begins a cascade of processes designed to mobilize her to either run (flight) or fight. Messages from her amygdala to her hypothalamus result in the activation of hormones that tell the adrenal glands to release a hormone called <em>cortisol</em>.

Again, if we zoom in, we can understand that our bodies are usually protected from too much cortisol by a feedback loop that reduces cortisol release once circulating levels reach a certain point. It is likely that this feedback loop malfunctions in stress-related disorders, such as depression (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a>).</p> <p id="DBPYG7P8M8WL7LGAS524" id-sequence="34">While still at the microscopic level, we might also see that one person’s genetic makeup might predispose that individual to have a more or less dramatic response to perceived stressors. By now, you can probably anticipate that we have to zoom back out again to fully understand this situation. These genetic differences among individuals interact with developmental and social factors, such as the possibility that this woman was maltreated as a child or now enjoys a strong social network of family and friends.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17d6 rs_skip" id="QWTB96WWQRMYY030T113" clrenderdata="[&quot;NXGJCJ4DVWCA2XMHC211&quot;]" id-sequence="35"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="285" data-height="348" data-alt="Professional athletes like Lydia Ko of New Zealand have learned to cope with stress to perform their best."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="JTYMPL1VQKJB00E4S627" id-sequence="36"><p>Professional athletes like Lydia Ko of New Zealand have learned to cope with stress to perform their best.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:285px;height:348px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Professional athletes like Lydia Ko of New Zealand have learned to cope with stress to perform their best." width="285" height="348" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Denis Balibouse/Reuters </div> </div></div></div> <p id="UBRA7QC5966RUEUTQ526" id-sequence="37">We can’t make your stress go away, and it is probably not in your best interests for us to do so.

People’s stressors are highly individual and idiosyncratic. The object of one person’s phobia may be another person’s beloved (although scaly and slithery) pet. Regardless of the stressor responsible for feelings of stress, once people perceive that they are in some kind of danger, a common and predictable set of responses to the stressor is set in motion.</p> <p id="NFMSUYSAKQM76BGDZ033" id-sequence="52">Psychologists have identified positive outcomes of our responses to stress (<span class="citation" id="SGBR9BB65FYG43RFV522" id-sequence="53">Selye, 1975</span>). Stress, by its nature, is a powerful adaptive response that mobilizes the body’s resources to enhance survival in dangerous situations (<span class="citation" id="WGNRK1BYMEWU7618J850" id-sequence="54">Meaney, 2010</span>). Although sometimes unpleasant, stress can motivate us to perform well and makes us healthier in the long run (<span class="citation" id="MZYHC3ZD57VT4DZNE693" id-sequence="55">Crum, Salovey, &amp; Achor, 2013</span>). The exercise we do at the gym is undeniably stressful, but it produces significant benefits down the road. Many of us do some of our best work under time pressure and are not too much the worse for the wear as a result.</p> <p id="ESLV6WFBP4VV7FQAZ074" id-sequence="56">Stress might have additional positive impacts on groups of people, not just individuals. People experiencing stress are actually more prosocial, at least with people they know well (<span class="citation" id="MFHABYSQTLLK65Y36512" id-sequence="57">Buchanan &amp; Preston, 2014</span>; <span class="citation" id="CLDHV24VX5JJCWTK6451" id-sequence="58"> Margittai et al., 2015</span>). Stress seems to increase our ability to empathize with others in pain (<span class="citation" id="NKQNAF8PZMSTLD8T1737" id-sequence="59">Tomova et al., 2016</span>). While personally unpleasant, these advantages of stress for our social networks could produce enormous benefits.</p> <p id="RCRD4D7FVUCXBJET8910" id-sequence="60">However, in other cases, stress can be counterproductive and interfere with our performance and well-being. In extreme cases, as observed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-chapter-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523" data-element-id="KNKVM7TED147CWT15523">Chapter 14</a>, a diathesis–stress model predicts that stress can contribute to the development of major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other serious conditions. These negative outcomes are more likely when we are unable to cope with or adapt to a stressor. We will be focusing most of our discussion on these negative situations.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="61"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="64"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="65" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="66" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="KMJZ3FAPALVX475V6577" id-sequence="67"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">16-1a</span> <span class="headingText">The Stress Response</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="JUYFH4U20LX7SE7EE889_content" id-sequence="68"> <p id="VYNFL78YTQ4DFL7J1413" id-sequence="69">Walter Cannon, whom we met in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapter 7</a>, demonstrated the ability of a number of stressors to activate the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">7</a>. <span class="citation" id="KBRAEJ36LP9R6BCSL730" id-sequence="70"> Cannon (1929)</span> reported that extreme cold, lack of oxygen, and emotional experiences all had the capacity to initiate a fight-or-flight response.

</span>. During this stage, we continue to experience ongoing stress, which requires us to adapt and cope as well as possible. Although resistance is not as dramatic as the briefer and more intense alarm reaction, it can still take its toll. Under normal circumstances, we alternate between periods of calm and periods of relative arousal. You might calmly enjoy your lunch on the lawn between classes but feel aroused while taking a quiz in a later class. During the calm periods, we have an opportunity to store nutrients and rest and repair the body. During periods of arousal, such as during the quiz, we expend energy instead of storing it. In the resistance phase of the GAS, we attempt to take care of both arousal and resting functions simultaneously. Neither function operates as smoothly under these circumstances as when it is operating alone. You might get an upset stomach when digesting your lunch is combined with the excitement of giving an oral presentation to your classmates. In contrast to the mental clarity that typically accompanies the brief alarm reaction, judgment during the longer periods of resistance may not be as good.</p> <p id="LJMG65H3P4WUQBZ5V216" id-sequence="261">If stressors are severe and last long enough, a person might reach Selye’s <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf137d" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf137d"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf137d" id="LVXQAZNAJM0NBESEP206" id-sequence="262"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">exhaustion</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="ZAZTFTWENJQ51P9T7722" id-sequence="263">exhaustion</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">The third and last stage of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), characterized by depletion of physical and psychological resources</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf137d">

Exhaustion can even lead to death. Forced marches during war produce higher rates of death than the rate that might be expected to occur because of injuries and lack of food. Similar observations of stress, exhaustion, and death have been made among baboons in Kenya (<span class="citation" id="HFTDFSDFCBJYT64JF846" id-sequence="264">Sapolsky, 2001</span>). Under normal circumstances, lower-status baboons avoid higher-status baboons whenever possible. Unfortunately, because of fears of losing their crops, the Kenyan villagers caged the local baboons one year. While caged, the lower-status baboons had no way to escape the higher-status animals, and many died as a result. They did not die, as you might have guessed, from battle wounds resulting from fights with the higher-status animals. Instead, the baboons died from stress-related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="265"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="268"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="269" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="270" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="GBZKZS03UYMSWQPX8024" id-sequence="271"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">16-1b</span> <span class="headingText">Sources of Stress</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="XPHY99S863ZHKRDQW821_content" id-sequence="272"> <p id="MQXYP2HZ4DYAK7NFJ562" id-sequence="273">Stressors exist in the eye of the beholder.

According to this approach, we make appraisals, or rapid initial assessments, of potential stressors to determine whether they are irrelevant or harmless, positive or negative.

Three weeks after a 2004 tsunami, prevalence of PTSD among children in areas of Sri Lanka ranged between 14% and 39% and could be predicted by variables such as family loss and severity of exposure (<span class="citation" id="AQBGDMYTGRGX13P1L705" id-sequence="289">Neuner, Schauer, Catani, Ruf, &amp; Elbert, 2006</span>). To put these very high numbers of childhood cases into perspective, we would expect about 10% of the general population to experience PTSD after most large disasters (<span class="citation" id="UBCFF6RM6YYZ92DU0617" id-sequence="290">Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, &amp; Nelson, 1996</span>). Automobile accidents are a major source of PTSD in childhood, with about 25% of children developing the disorder after being injured in an accident (de Vries et al., 1999).</p> <p id="ZMMXE0AE00HXMU0RK188" id-sequence="291">Although disasters are dramatic, they are not the only sources of stress that we face. Changes, including some changes for the better, can also trigger stress. Holmes and Rahe (1967) compiled a list of life events (good and bad) that they believed might be correlated with stress and then surveyed participants about the amount of adjustment that each event required. Subsequently, researchers used the Holmes and Rahe scales to predict vulnerability to physical illness and psychological disorder because of different stressors (<span class="citation" id="AYUGY4MET8RMGKPU1713" id-sequence="292">Derogatis &amp; Coons, 1993</span>; <span class="citation" id="ARFD8ZQ6AVWDBNYDX263" id-sequence="293"> Scully, Tosi, &amp; Banning, 2000</span>). According to the scales, Christmas is more stressful than minor violations of the law. Getting married is more stressful than being fired from your job. Research results from studies using the Holmes and Rahe scales suggest that we should consider spreading out controllable changes over time. In other words, it may not be the best strategy to graduate from college, get married, move to a new city, and start a new job, all at the same time.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17db rs_skip" id="THYV23QPZ30D42PJ1671" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZDPDW9FLLB4NB3BG3470&quot;]" id-sequence="294"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf05-t2.jpg" data-width="336" data-height="235" data-alt="A photo shows a young man with his hands folded and fingers tightly gripped in front of his face, looking stressed."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="EPXARYMCCX5U7FHFY312" id-sequence="295"><p>This man is obviously stressed.

The SAM system initiates the release of adrenaline (also known as <em>epinephrine</em>) and norepinephrine into the bloodstream from the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys in your lower back.

The sympathetic adrenal–medullary (SAM) system responds quickly by initiating the release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. These chemical messengers initiate many immediate, short-lived responses, such as a pounding heart and rapid breathing. Simultaneously, activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis results in the release of cortisol into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. Cortisol acts to boost the energy available for dealing with the stress. Cortisol receptors in the hippocampus serve as a feedback loop to keep the system from overreacting. The effects of HPA axis activity are slower to develop and last longer than those of the SAM response. HPA axis activity is associated with more of the effects of chronic stress, such as suppression of the immune system.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:519px;height:618px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_f04-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="An illustration shows how two systems respond to a stressor.The illustration is split into two sections: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (slower), on the left, and Sympathetic adrenal-medullary (SAM) system (faster), on the right.

The HPA axis response to stress can continue longer than the SAM response, which explains many of the outcomes of chronic stress.</p> <p id="RCSSDG5YQ2BULZWS6001" id-sequence="363">One of the possible outcomes of chronic stress is prolonged high levels of circulating cortisol. Long-term exposure to cortisol can produce a number of harmful effects, including the death of neurons. When rats received daily injections of the rat equivalent of cortisol, neural death began to occur in just a few weeks (Stein-Behrens, Mattson, Chang, Yeh, &amp; Sapolsky, 1994). Identical amounts of neural death occurred if the rats were stressed daily instead of<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_647" data-page="647"></a> receiving the injections, suggesting that the action of cortisol is responsible for most of the neural damage observed to result from stress. Cushing’s disease, a medical condition that causes unusually high cortisol levels, results in reduced hippocampus volume, memory problems, abnormal sleep patterns, and depression (<span class="citation" id="LTNLT8CQG7R09YLZF973" id-sequence="364">Langenecker et al., 2012</span>). Not only can high levels of cortisol damage neurons, but these same levels appear to inhibit <em>neurogenesis</em>, or the birth of neurons, which might help to offset the damage (<span class="citation" id="ZVVFCKUMGY7TLX50V566" id-sequence="365">Cowen, 2010</span>).</p> <p id="DWLW1W4RKZ8B65XPX565" id-sequence="366">Normally, activity of the HPA axis is regulated by a feedback loop involving the hippocampus (<span class="citation" id="HNYPBB4D5R9LWAU2W190" id-sequence="367">Stokes, 1995</span>). The hippocampus works like a rev limiter in an automobile engine that prevents the driver from going over a certain speed. The hippocampus contains large numbers of receptors for cortisol and other stress hormones. When the hippocampus detects high levels of these hormones, it signals the hypothalamus, which in turn tells the adrenal glands to reduce the release of cortisol, and arousal dissipates.</p> <p id="LGTG2PB9JPG216U9P819" id-sequence="368">The role of the hippocampus as the rev limiter of the HPA axis might be the bridge between extreme stress and MDD.

Consistently elevated levels of cortisol because of stress can overwhelm the hippocampus’s feedback loop, leading instead to the continuous release of cortisol and constant arousal. Without the regulation of cortisol usually provided by the hippocampus acting as a rev limiter, a person can begin to experience depression (<span class="citation" id="FENSHY71E1AZWYESV832" id-sequence="369">Stokes, 1995</span>). People who are treated with cortisol and similar stress hormones for medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are often troubled by deep depression, reinforcing the role of excess cortisol in depressed mood.</p> <p id="AQKA4Z2XS857M4YRR187" id-sequence="370">Not only can the hippocampus fail to regulate cortisol release under conditions of extreme stress, but continued stress can damage the hippocampus further.

The Type As most at risk for heart disease were frequently suspicious, angry, and resentful of other people.

In a heart attack, interruptions of blood flow to the heart trigger death of a part of the cardiac muscle. Flexible blood vessels maintain blood flow and blood pressure and lessen the chances of a heart attack.

A change in one of these behaviors usually results in changes in the others. Long-term, chronic stress can begin a cascade of changes in mood, sleep, and appetite that compromise well-being. Disruptions of sleep because of stress are particularly hazardous to health because we need sleep to restore our bodies after the challenges of the day. Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are associated with both overall health and cognitive outcomes (<span class="citation" id="HHZMXCSWQ0M3ZMVBP486" id-sequence="518">Hawkley &amp; Cacioppo, 2010</span>).</p> <p id="UZNRPLUXJNHTZ6YF9438" id-sequence="519">Stress frequently serves as a trigger for a depressed mood.

Cortisol is released in large quantities early in the morning, contributing to wakefulness. As the day progresses, cortisol levels drop off, reducing wakefulness and setting the stage for sleep. If you experience a big jolt of cortisol because of a stressor late in the evening, getting to sleep is going to be difficult, even when you’re tired. Even when you do get to sleep, high levels of cortisol interfere with good sleep quality (<span class="citation" id="GQGZ6V06NACSL10JF464" id-sequence="523">Van Cauter, Leproult, &amp; Plat, 2000</span>).

Among the criteria for MDD are changes in appetite. Some people who are depressed lose weight without dieting, while others gain weight. By now, it shouldn’t surprise you to learn that stress, along with depression, also can contribute to obesity.

Stressed mice gained more weight than mice that were not stressed, even when both were fed the same high-fat, high-sugar diet. In addition to this direct effect of stress on appetite, stress can produce indirect effects on obesity by interfering with sleep. Dieters who enjoyed a full night’s sleep lost the same amount of weight as dieters who slept less, but there was a difference in the kind of weight that was lost (<span class="citation" id="FGAVVSFAHDPEGEV51992" id-sequence="531">Nedeltcheva, Kilkus, Imperial, Schoeller, &amp; Penev, 2010</span>).

Popular wisdom suggests that people with the highest levels of stress should therefore experience the worst health. However, we have already seen one example, the healthy Type As, in which this was not the case. In another study, 5,000 men reported their stress levels, which were then compared 20 years later to their medical records.

For many students, college can mean new environments, new rules and routines, new social interactions, less sleep, not-so-great eating habits, and more sitting than exercising. Can the application of psychological research make the transition into college easier and less stressful?</p> <p id="PBEGFC29XCLRA3ADS826" id-sequence="557">We can’t make many of these stressors go away, but a simple, one-time intervention at the beginning of the first year of college made a large difference in the academic performance and health of a group of students in one study (<span class="citation" id="JAEBK5W5W094DVFPC939" id-sequence="558">Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011</span>). Incoming first-year students at Stanford University were randomly assigned to a control group or a social-belonging group. The social-belonging group read what they thought were the results of a survey of older students, who said that they had worried about fitting in during their first year but had grown more confident over time. Participants were asked to write an essay comparing their own first-year experiences with the survey results and then deliver a speech based on their essay to a video camera for use with future students. At no time were the participants aware that they were actually experiencing a “treatment” designed to make them see the social stressors of college life as typical of all students and of short duration.</p> <p id="TMNZED7Q0289WAV6Y609" id-sequence="559">Over the next three years, the participants’ grade point averages (GPAs) and health were monitored. The “belongingness” intervention had little impact on the health and grades of White students, but it had significant and positive effects on African American students. Compared to African American students in the control group, the students who had received the one-time reassurance that their concerns about fitting in were normal and were not permanent had higher grades, fewer visits to the doctor, and higher subjective happiness (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QNNTAE81ZKYP8T0H1392" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-section-id="AZKA0YQGKJYKSAFX7177" data-element-id="QNNTAE81ZKYP8T0H1392">Figure 16.8</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ea rs_skip" id="QNNTAE81ZKYP8T0H1392" clrenderdata="[&quot;NDFXSPZZ9PFP13V5G718&quot;]" id-sequence="560"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_f08-t2.png" data-width="446" data-height="226" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the subjective happiness scores of White students and African American students in randomized control group and after receiving social belonging treatment.

Take a minute to jot down the things that you found most stressful five years ago and then make a list of the stressors that you face today. Would you trade today’s list for the one from five years ago? Most people would do so in a heartbeat. Life gets more complicated and often more stressful, but our skills for coping improve at the same time. People tend to report less stress as they get older (<span class="citation" id="AYZF4JP7BDFW5RW68359" id-sequence="576">Shields, 2004</span>).</p> <p id="BXDW4QW1WQNDL7HTK706" id-sequence="577">Earlier in this chapter, we described the role of cognitive appraisal in identifying a stimulus or event as a stressor. Appraisal plays an important role in coping with identified stressors as well. Once a stressor has been identified, a second set of appraisals occurs that guides our coping responses (<span class="citation" id="XSHACMRQFPHS756S4601" id-sequence="578">Lazarus, 1966</span>). What harm has already occurred? What threats remain? What resources do we need to overcome the challenge? Taking conscious control of our appraisals can contribute to our ability to cope.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="579"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="582"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="583" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="584" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="TVGD562C3GVZAKG7J340" id-sequence="585"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">16-4a</span> <span class="headingText">Managing Stress</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="PMVZY692C4Z8HGJ1M638_content" id-sequence="586"> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="MXWZL1HER42LPYWD3089" id-sequence="587"><div class="sidebarContent" id="MXWZL1HER42LPYWD3089_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="588"> <p id="PUXGJCG7D9QVR9GD1264" id-sequence="589">Even when a stressor takes us by surprise, we can regain a sense of control. Viktor Frankl (1959, p. 161), a Holocaust survivor, developed what he described as “tragic optimism” for coping with unforeseen disasters. Instead of asking why these disasters should happen to us, Frankl recommends that people exert a sense of control by asking, “How can I face this disaster with courage and responsibility?”</p> </div></div> <p id="ZDCZD3C858E3TYJL9041" id-sequence="590">An obvious starting place for keeping your levels of stress low is to ask whether stressors can be eliminated. If you feel stressed about having too much to do and too little time to do it, it might be possible to reduce your workload or practice better time management skills. If money is tight, a visit to your campus’s financial aid office might provide you with solutions that you had not considered. The worst possible approach is to withdraw and avoid stressors in the vain hope that they will go away. Your latest credit card statement is not going to get better magically if you ignore it. In fact, your emotional response to seeing the statement on your desk every day is likely to get a lot worse over time.</p> <p id="LNFG5SCLYKMP43VG8713" id-sequence="591">A major variable that predicts our response to stress is the sense of control. Feeling surprised by life or out of control can lead to significant stress. Some of the worst stressors are those that seem to strike randomly, such as being diagnosed with lung cancer when you never smoked (<span class="citation" id="FWUP4TQFS25PRC3JF313" id-sequence="592">Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, &amp; Grant, 2011</span>). These seemingly random events undercut our sense of control, countering the belief that “If I don’t smoke, I am ensuring that my lungs will stay healthy.”</p> <p id="XQJUPV9ULVAWNK94Y230" id-sequence="593">Many stressors are out of our control, however. We can’t wish our cancer away or magically ensure that enough money appears in our bank accounts to pay this month’s bills. However, we can respond to our stressors in ways that reduce our overall stress. This approach is consistent with the elements of positive psychology, which we review later in this chapter. Even if you are struggling with a life-threatening disease, stress can be reduced by educating yourself as much as possible about your condition and participating fully in decisions about your treatment. Residents of nursing homes who have more control over their choice of daily activities live longer than those who are not given such choices (<span class="citation" id="LERLTQL8EF5FJVQXH019" id-sequence="594">Rodin, 1986</span>).

For example, people caring for Alzheimer’s patients, which can be stressful, exhibited both positive coping, including empathy, support, and compromise; and negative coping, including confronting, ignoring, blaming, and withdrawal (<span class="citation" id="AYRZVNJKZYNVN0B6P130" id-sequence="640">Kramer, 1993</span>).</p> <p id="FRTLTJ0N7RJ4QMVXJ122" id-sequence="641">As we have seen so frequently in our discussions of human behavior, the choice of a coping approach results from interactions between people and the situation in question (<span class="citation" id="PJFQ521M5HZ2YKKYM166" id-sequence="642">Aldwin, 1994</span>). For example, people who score high on the Big Five trait of neuroticism (discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>) tend to experience more distress than people with low neuroticism scores (<span class="citation" id="XKBRRS8ZF2KGT8QZS589" id-sequence="643">Bolger &amp; Schilling, 1991</span>). When responding to stressors in the work situation, people high in neuroticism are more likely to engage in negative problem-focused coping, such as escaping the situation (<span class="citation" id="BNUDX64LLXGN2E0QP636" id-sequence="644">O’Brien &amp; DeLongis, 1996</span>). When dealing with interpersonal stress, however, people with high neuroticism use the negative relationship-focused coping strategy of confrontation. People with high neuroticism also cope differently with stress involving close relationships<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_658" data-page="658"></a> (significant others, family members, and close friends) than with stress involving distant relationships (coworkers and neighbors). They are more likely to use a positive relationship-focused coping method, empathy, when dealing with distant relationships than when dealing with close relationships (O’Brien &amp; DeLongis, 1996).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ef rs_skip" id="NXTS5NLX5BVCL8JKP241" clrenderdata="[&quot;XUBWADZELVY6QTH4Z800&quot;]" id-sequence="645"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf17-t2.jpg" data-width="580" data-height="266" data-alt="Three Photos: First shows a young woman reading a book sitting on grass, second shows a man, lying down on grass with a sheet above it, with food by his side and having a bite.

In contrast, when people lack resilience, they feel overwhelmed, helpless, and victimized.

Because of improved sanitation and vaccination, the threats to health faced today are quite different from those faced by earlier generations. In 1900, the leading causes of death in the United States were pneumonia, influenza, and tuberculosis, but by 2005, the leading causes of death were heart disease, cancer, lung disease, and stroke (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BMAQP90QA889AZ7AE102" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-section-id="MFLR3HUDTV2AKZZ1W622" data-element-id="BMAQP90QA889AZ7AE102">Figure 16.12</a>). In other words, we have gone from facing major threats from infectious, short-duration conditions to noninfectious, long-term conditions. In the last few decades, considerable progress was made in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This improvement in turn has resulted in a larger number of Americans who are living long enough to be diagnosed with age-related conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17f6 rs_skip" id="BMAQP90QA889AZ7AE102" clrenderdata="[&quot;PHLCNS5Q9BFU073PE621&quot;]" id-sequence="728"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_f12-t2.png" data-width="552" data-height="358" data-alt="A horizontal bar graph shows the causes of death and the deaths per year in thousands in the United States.

People who have never smoked still get lung cancer, and thin, fit people get heart disease. The relationships between lifestyle factors and health are derived from the statistical analyses of large populations, not single individuals. At the same time, understanding that most people who engage in particular behaviors have certain health outcomes can provide us with clues for maintaining the healthiest lifestyles possible.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="734"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="737"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="738" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="739" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="JZET3PMJ9MKPD4G4K278" id-sequence="740"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">16-5a</span> <span class="headingText">Behavior and Health</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="TJMTBQ1M76VQP0XN0433_content" id-sequence="741"> <p id="WVGFGU9BVV0C0TRTC948" id-sequence="742"><em>Consumer Reports</em> conducted a survey of 1,000 Americans to see how many engaged in everyday prevention behaviors (<a target="_blank" id="AHHKSAAKF890TFRBD845" name="AHHKSAAKF890TFRBD845" class="external" href="http://ConsumerReports.org" id-sequence="743">ConsumerReports.org</a>, 2009).

On average, smokers die 13–14 years earlier than nonsmokers. Tobacco use can lead to additional health problems. Nicotine is a well- established gateway drug, capable of producing epigenetic changes that increase the likelihood of addiction to cocaine (<span class="citation" id="RRJQTT3MZTWYY2NMF758" id-sequence="862">Li et al., 2014</span>). Tobacco’s effects are not restricted to its users either. In the United States, exposure to secondhand smoke leads to 3,400 lung cancer deaths, 46,000 heart disease deaths, 430 cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), 24,500 low-birth-weight babies, 71,900 preterm deliveries, and 200,000 episodes of childhood asthma each year (WHO, 2008).</p> <p id="BLABTWB9231NMUS6D926" id-sequence="863">Cigarette smokers in the United States dropped from 21% of adults in 2005 to just 15% in 2015 (<span class="citation" id="FVJLY4DTWYEH3L5HT751" id-sequence="864">Jamal et al., 2016</span>) (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QUPQJAB7TD7XUWFAE781" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-section-id="TJMTBQ1M76VQP0XN0433" data-element-id="QUPQJAB7TD7XUWFAE781">Figure 16.14</a>). Worldwide, however, rates of smoking are higher than those found in the United States and other developed countries. According to the WHO (2008), two thirds of current smokers live in developing countries, with 30% of smokers residing in China and 10% in India. Gender, race, ethnicity, education, mental health, and income are strong determinants of the likelihood of smoking. In the United States, men are more likely to smoke than women (16.7%, as opposed to 13.6%). American Indians or Alaska Natives reported the highest incidence of smoking (21.9%), followed by non-Hispanic multirace individuals (20.2%), non-Hispanic Whites (16.6%), non-Hispanic Blacks (16.7%), Hispanics (10.1%), and Asians (7.0 %). Lesbian/gay/bisexual individuals were more likely to smoke cigarettes (20.6%) than heterosexual individuals (14.9%). Smoking drops with increasing education, from 34.1% of individuals with a general equivalency diploma (GED) certificate to 3.6% of adults with a graduate degree. Poverty plays a strong role in smoking; 26.1% of adults living below the poverty line compared to 13.9% living at or above the poverty line report smoking.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17f8 rs_skip" id="QUPQJAB7TD7XUWFAE781" clrenderdata="[&quot;HFFHXT336LKPHXQ1K725&quot;]" id-sequence="865"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_f14-t2.png" data-width="265" data-height="290" data-alt="A horizontal double bar graph shows the percentage of cigarette smokers in U.S. for different age groups in 2005 and 2015.

In the United States alone, excessive alcohol consumption leads to approximately 88,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $249 billion (NIAAA, 2017). Alcohol-impaired driving accounts for 31% of all driving fatalities in the United States.</p> <p id="AQTFT4BDSTHPK4D5R507" id-sequence="924">In addition, alcohol poses a risk of abuse and dependence for many people. Psychologists define <em>alcohol abuse</em> as repeated use despite adverse consequences and <em>alcohol dependence</em> as alcohol abuse accompanied by tolerance, withdrawal, and a compulsive urge to drink more (APA, 2013). As observed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>, <em>tolerance</em> is defined as the need to administer greater quantities of a drug to maintain the same subjective effect, and <em>withdrawal</em> refers to symptoms that occur when a habitually used drug is no longer used.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_667" data-page="667"></a> <p id="FECG357K4AYF3Z33X054" id-sequence="925">As we have seen in so many other domains of human behavior, complex interactions between biological and environmental factors lead to alcohol abuse and dependence. Genes related to the body’s ability to break down alcohol in the liver are not evenly distributed across the world’s populations. Certain types of genes found primarily in Asians are correlated with lower rates of alcohol dependence (<span class="citation" id="QRLSB314E51SEXZUY202" id-sequence="926">Eng, Luczak, &amp; Wall, 2007</span>). To illustrate the need to consider more than simply genetic predisposition, however, see the example of Native Americans, who have much higher rates of alcohol dependence than do many other ethnic groups in the United States, despite a high prevalence of the supposedly “protective” genes (<span class="citation" id="TUNY8G3TKLQ5BZVZP235" id-sequence="927">Ehlers, 2007</span>).</p> <p id="GGWAWJA0Y3FGYT3ED863" id-sequence="928">Many of the same factors that encourage teens to begin smoking also encourage drinking. Most people who go on to abuse alcohol are drinking heavily by late adolescence, and most cases of alcohol dependence are well established by the age of 30 years (<span class="citation" id="JMTANG8PKVVR8HAT5949" id-sequence="929">Enoch, 2006</span>). This timeline provides insight into when prevention programs are likely to be most effective. Peer pressure, the need to fit in or look cool, overestimates of “Everybody’s doing it,” modeling the behavior of parents and other family members, and the teen’s characteristic sense of being immune to harm from risky behavior can contribute to decisions to begin drinking. Because alcohol reduces anxiety, socially anxious teens are especially at risk for problem drinking. If teens feel more socially competent while drinking, they are likely to continue this practice because of operant conditioning, as described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-chapter-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317" data-element-id="QYWRDYP5W4T8QDDWS317">Chapter 8</a>. Reduced feelings of anxiety are rewarding, so a person is likely to repeat the behavior (alcohol consumption, in this case) associated with this reward.</p> <p id="ZGJFUQM9LRAUYUBHT053" id-sequence="930">Among the environmental influences on problem drinking is the age at which people take their first drink. Individuals exposed to alcohol at earlier ages show a much higher rate of alcohol dependence later in life. Again, we find that age of first drink interacts with a person’s genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence (<span class="citation" id="TSCBAMUQCV5K4RMMS852" id-sequence="931">Agrawal et al., 2009</span>). In yet another example of the epigenetic mechanisms discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-chapter-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-element-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455">Chapter 3</a>, early exposure to alcohol might affect the expression of genes related to problem drinking. A similar interaction is found between the maltreatment and neglect of a child and the genetic vulnerability to alcohol dependence. Not all children who are maltreated go on to become dependent on alcohol, although many do (Shin, Edwards, Heeren, &amp; Amodeo, 2009; <span class="citation" id="ELLW6NSL8X08LYKKT941" id-sequence="932"> Shin, Edwards, &amp; Heeren, 2009</span>). The maltreated children who do not develop drinking problems are likely to be protected by combinations of genetic predisposition and the presence of peer and parental support (<span class="citation" id="BAPCYQQP2WWKZSU3H968" id-sequence="933">Enoch, 2006</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf17ff rs_skip" id="EQMBMLMKA34C02KNN689" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZKTTMMTA8W5LF4YG7167&quot;]" id-sequence="934"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf25-t2.jpg" data-width="432" data-height="273" data-alt="A photo taken in a club environment shows two young women dancing, carrying beer on their hands."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="JGPTZJRV303B2YL1U274" id-sequence="935"><p>People who are exposed to alcohol at younger ages have the highest risk for alcohol abuse.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:432px;height:273px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_unf25-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo taken in a club environment shows two young women dancing, carrying beer on their hands." width="432" height="273" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Diverse Images/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <p id="LNGQJ7RWKH3LVCZAL056" id-sequence="936">Treatment for very heavy drinkers often requires medical supervision because withdrawal from alcohol can produce life-threatening seizures.

In today’s sedentary lifestyle, however, in which many workers spend hours commuting in cars to sit for more hours in front of computers, exercise becomes something that we must consciously remember to do. Children in previous generations would dash from school to play outdoors, but social changes, including lack of supervision at home and safety concerns, have led to much less spontaneous outdoor activity. Parents might prefer that their children stay indoors playing video games rather than ride their<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_668" data-page="668"></a> bicycles in the neighborhood. For many middle-aged and older adults, loneliness might lead to less physical activity (<span class="citation" id="KEGPNZU8ZKT44WQ8B238" id-sequence="944">Hawkley &amp; Cacioppo, 2010</span>; <span class="citation" id="ZRGQQFWF9SPL2U49S151" id-sequence="945"> Hawkley, Thisted, &amp; Cacioppo, 2009</span>).</p> <p id="LVBYZJ36P8MGAKZSQ013" id-sequence="946">Lack of exercise and sitting are related but different issues.

Risk of death is lowest among Asians and Pacific Islanders and highest among the non-Hispanic Black population (Kochanek, Murphy, Xu, &amp; Tejada-Vera, 2017). Although life expectancy for White and Black Americans differs, the gap continues to<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_670" data-page="670"></a> narrow. In 2000, life expectancy for Whites was 5.5 years more than life expectancy for Blacks, but this gap was reduced to 3.8 years by 2010. Increases in life expectancy across all ethnic groups resulted from reductions in the rate of death from leading causes, including heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and stroke.</p> <p id="LDTM7L3EH3TR6ZW5C784" id-sequence="983">Compared to white Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have been as much as two to three times less likely to have health insurance (<span class="citation" id="DASRSPDZFRQ28XQR5503" id-sequence="984">Derksen, 2013</span>). Not only do these discrepancies burden minorities with increased disability, but they contribute to continued poverty and violence affecting society as a whole. A shortage of physicians willing to treat racial and ethnic minorities and non-English-speaking patients contributes to health disparities as well (<span class="citation" id="QVMXDK58BUVEDRHMF157" id-sequence="985">Marrast, Zallman, Woolhandler, Bor, &amp; McCormick, 2013</span>).</p> <p id="FXXH8EYMS2EXHDBQH129" id-sequence="986">In addition to ethnic and cultural differences in overall health and health habits, discrepancies occur in mental health. Minorities living in the United States have less access to mental health services, are less likely to receive needed services, receive a poorer quality of care, and are underrepresented in mental health research (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; U.S. Public Health Service, 2007). Among possible variables accounting for increased mental health problems among minorities are poverty, discrimination, and violence. Poverty in particular is an important risk factor for psychological disorders, with people living at the lowest levels of the socioeconomic scale experiencing two to three times greater rates of psychological disorder (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Public Health Service, 2007). The exact prevalence remains unknown because many people living in poverty do not have access to care. Stress from poverty, discrimination, and violence might contribute to higher rates of stress-related health problems and disorders. Distrust of clinicians who might seem to be disrespectful or whose approach is culturally insensitive also might deter people from obtaining the treatment that they need.</p> <p id="BSMMH3HL3FF1DUBZ4531" id-sequence="987">Culture contributes to risk for suicide as well. In 2015, the highest rates of suicide in the United States among individuals aged 10 years or older occurred among Whites (15.1%), followed by American Indians/Alaska Natives (12.6%), Asian or Pacific Islander groups (6.4%), Hispanics (5.8%), and non-Hispanic Blacks (5.6%; <span class="citation" id="FECCJXYJP26SAFUZQ944" id-sequence="988"> Curtin, Warner, &amp; Hedegaard, 2016</span>).

Stress can lead to poor sleep, additional consumption of calories, more smoking, more drinking, and less exercise. People who eat poorly are unlikely to sleep well or feel like going to the gym. Smoking reduces weight (naming a cigarette marketed to women “Virginia Slims” was no accident), but of course, it has negative effects on health that far outweigh that advantage. Problem drinkers either cut back on nutritious food or become obese (<span class="citation" id="BBEE8ZJYUPBM98EEK437" id-sequence="998">Breslow &amp; Smothers, 2005</span>). College students engage in <em>drunkorexia</em>, or the deliberate restriction of calories before planned alcohol consumption for the purpose of avoiding weight gain (Burke, Cremeens, Vail-Smith, &amp; Woolsey, 2010). Most of if not all these behaviors are affected by our social context.

</span> focuses on these relatively neglected areas of behavior and mental processes by using scientific methods to understand positive human experiences and adjustment. A new set of interventions should emerge from this understanding that will guide individuals, families, and communities in their attempts to maximize their potential (<span class="citation" id="RKGCB4MD0KZPJTBKD495" id-sequence="1071">Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</span>).</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_673" data-page="673"></a> <p id="ZQLNDGNG099394Y1H576" id-sequence="1072">William James foreshadowed positive psychology in his 1902 book <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>. In this book, James discussed people who achieve “healthy mindedness” as having an understanding of the “goodness of life” and a soul (a word often used by people in James’s era as synonymous with <em>mind</em>) with “a sky-blue tint” (<span class="citation" id="KRGYLYVTGBCAPS4A8196" id-sequence="1073">James, 1905</span>, pp. 79–80). James goes further to speculate about the origins of healthy mindedness. For the lucky few, healthy mindedness occurs naturally and effortlessly. For others, it must be achieved through effort.</p> <p id="BGED7V7MC4URF9UFU749" id-sequence="1074">Despite James’s efforts, psychology continued its fascination with the abnormal and the unhealthy into the 20th century and did not direct the same energy toward understanding the normal and healthy. Voices of dissent arose from among the humanistic psychologists, including Abraham Maslow, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">12</a>. Maslow argued that psychologists could learn more about human behavior by studying outstanding individuals than by studying people with severe problems. As part of Maslow’s thinking about self-actualization, the pinnacle of social motivation in his theory, he took detailed notes on people he admired in a “GHB (Good Human Being) notebook” that he kept between 1945 and 1949 (<span class="citation" id="FNEFPKQYDZJ7J44BM108" id-sequence="1075">Lowry, 1973</span>). In addition to making observations of living people whom he admired, Maslow combed through biographies and autobiographies of famous people in search of common features of healthy mindedness.</p> <p id="LKJLUPPSA9BVK6QHC598" id-sequence="1076">Running parallel to the humanistic psycholgists’ rejection of a negative, sickness model of human behavior were innovations among cognitive and behavioral approaches. As mentioned in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-element-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551">Chapter 15</a>, Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck were achieving excellent results with cognitive restructuring around the same time that the humanistic psychologists began reconsidering Freud. Ellis and Beck were able to help their clients with MDD see a glass of water as half full as opposed to half empty, improving their mood and optimism in the process.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf180b rs_skip" id="QYJBRLCPE90VR7J7H173" clrenderdata="[&quot;ASGN3T37A8BD526YE298&quot;]" id-sequence="1077"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf33-t2.png" data-width="234" data-height="381" data-alt="In his book The Varieties of Religious Experience, William James foreshadowed the development of positive psychology by considering what makes some people healthy minded and what gives others a “sick soul.”"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="PYHLLSRPRC68UW883598" id-sequence="1078"><p>In his book <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>, William James foreshadowed the development of positive psychology by considering what makes some people healthy minded and what gives others a “sick soul.”</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:234px;height:381px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_unf33-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="In his book The Varieties of Religious Experience, William James foreshadowed the development of positive psychology by considering what makes some people healthy minded and what gives others a “sick soul.”" width="234" height="381" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Mary Evans Picture Library/The Image Works </div> </div></div></div> <p id="FHEPC53JHDUN7A6X5985" id-sequence="1079">One of the most significant voices leading to contemporary positive psychology approaches is that of Martin Seligman.

Changes in circumstances might raise or lower happiness from the set point, but the effect would be temporary.

Rather than looking for external things to boost happiness, such as a new car or a new nose, looking within is more effective. Happiness can be improved by thinking carefully about what things interfere with our happiness, such as allowing ourselves to stay mad at a partner following an argument, and working to avoid these things.</p> <div class="container dependent mt_diversevoicesinpsychology narrative  rs_skip" id="SVUDHMHLKFHR8TVQL519" label="diversevoicesinpsychology" id-sequence="1107"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Diverse Voices in Psychology</span><h3 id="AAPUM5RRF8M52TAJ2706" id-sequence="1108">Optimism across Race and Ethnicity</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="SVUDHMHLKFHR8TVQL519_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1109"> <p id="MEBCRVPT5BZ21L6XT202" id-sequence="1110">Like most of american psychology, positive psychology has been criticized as being overly influenced by the values of the white majority.

One possibility is that the relationship between marriage and happiness is a false one because of the likelihood that happy people produce happy marriages instead of the other way around. However, careful research that controls for premarital happiness does not support this hypothesis (Horwitz, White, &amp; Howell-White, 1997). Regardless of how happy people are before marrying, on average being married makes them happier.

Traditionally, psychologists have suggested that marital happiness results from the perceptions that one partner has of the other. But more sophisticated analyses have shown that the factors associated with marital happiness are more complicated (Luo, Zhang, Watson, &amp; Snider, 2010). While it’s true that perceptions of your partner influence how satisfied you are in a relationship (“I’m with a great person”), it is also true that your overall satisfaction with the relationship affects how you see your partner (“I’m happy, so I must be with a great person”). Then, what is the source of that satisfaction? A major factor in satisfaction with a relationship is how you think your partner sees you (“My partner thinks I’m terrific, which makes me happy, and because I’m happy, I must be with a great person”).</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="YHNJJSFQUZ3RYEJR6914" id-sequence="1139"> <h3 id="NTUHR3J3F5142W0EB315" id-sequence="1140"><span class="headingText">Happiness and Wealth</span></h3> <p id="VAYEDER9DTQKGG47J660" id-sequence="1141">Another common-sense notion about happiness is that wealth can make you happy. After all, we see frequent images of ecstatic lottery winners and smiling sports superstars who have signed megabuck contracts. At both national and individual levels, being poor does appear to be correlated with being unhappy. However, once basic needs are<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_677" data-page="677"></a> met, additional money does not guarantee happiness (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XEJDRVZVXQL34LMPS213" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-section-id="JMFE9QZRT82NLXMKH532" data-element-id="XEJDRVZVXQL34LMPS213">Figure 16.25</a>).

The Camelot Group, which manages the national lottery in the United Kingdom, reported that winning the lottery did have an impact on happiness (Camelot Group, 2004). According to these findings, 65% of winners reported that they were happier following the win because of financial security and increased freedom; 35% said that they were about as happy after winning as before; and none reported feeling less happy than before the win.

First, these scores tend to be highly heritable, which means that you can’t do much to improve your sense of pleasure. Some people seem to respond more intensely than others to pleasurable experiences. Second, these feelings do not last long and habituate quickly. Think about the last time you had a delicious dessert. The first few bites are fantastic, but the last ones are usually less so.

The games have clear goals (reaching the next level or beating a dungeon boss), they provide the opportunity to focus, they encourage a merging of action and awareness (as opposed to self-consciousness), and<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_679" data-page="679"></a> players generally experience a distortion of subjective time. In addition, games provide instant and precise feedback (you succeed or not), a balance between ability and difficulty (gamers reject games that are either too easy or too challenging), and a sense of personal control (you’re the one making the moves). Finally, gaming, like other flow activities, is intrinsically reinforcing. Many a parent has diabolically used access to gaming as a reinforcer for other desired behaviors, such as chores or homework.

Resilience not only serves as a buffer for stress but can lead to growth following a traumatic experience (Davis &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2009). None of us likes being traumatized, but when we look back on difficult episodes of our lives, we often feel like a traumatic experience led to growth and improved strength. Among the positive changes associated with posttraumatic growth are perceptions of the self as a survivor rather than a victim, increased self-confidence and self-efficacy, and greater appreciation for the fragile nature of life. Many people respond to prior trauma with increased compassion for others, closer bonds with family and friends, and enhanced willingness to share emotions. Trauma also can lead people to reduce the value that they place on material aspects of life, such as money and possessions, while increasing their sense of what is truly meaningful about life.</p> <p id="WMMKF85U1GS01TCN1168" id-sequence="1212">As we mentioned in a previous section, the experience of a meaningful life enhances well-being and happiness.

In discussing personality traits, we don’t want to think of traits as necessarily good or bad. A variety of personalities, such as the introverted computer programmer and the extroverted salesperson, helps meet the needs of society. In contrast, the values discussed by positive psychologists are good, and to be without them is not so good. This deviation from being nonjudgmental represents a significant departure by the positive psychologists from the humanistic psychologists, who argue strongly against any type of outward judgment of others.</p> <p id="BDFT36EZD2XBLHQ0D159" id-sequence="1224">Do values matter in everyday life?

However, possessing certain values seems to correlate with a number of positive outcomes.

In addition, explosiveness, or a propensity to violence, was negatively correlated with a person’s values ratings. As ratings on the values increased, a person’s potential for violent behavior decreased. People with high values scores were the least likely to experience alcohol or tobacco addictions or to experience anxiety and depression.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1817 rs_skip" id="USJRCAE59SUZKX51Z814" clrenderdata="[&quot;CSLUWN10WMYJGU3BP168&quot;]" id-sequence="1226"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf41-t2.png" data-width="248" data-height="110" data-alt="A logo of Rotary International with a tagline Service above Self."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="VJKT2JZZZ901KEYMG417" id-sequence="1227"><p>Organizations such as Rotary International often reinforce the values of their members, such as “service above self.”</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:248px;height:110px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_unf41-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A logo of Rotary International with a tagline Service above Self." width="248" height="110" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Rotary International <em>Source:</em> Service Above Self and the Service Above Self logo are trademarks of Rotary International and used herein with permission. </div> </div></div></div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1228"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1231"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1232" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1233" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="AHKH4MSBBF0J62KQY754" id-sequence="1234"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">16-6c</span> <span class="headingText">Positive Institutions</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="HEANEKDVJWWB2VRQE177_content" id-sequence="1235"> <p id="FZFSG2ZDU357WB8CQ399" id-sequence="1236">Positive psychologists study the roles of institutions such as workplaces, schools, and families in promoting well-being in the community. What characteristics should we strive for in our institutions to raise the likelihood that members of the community will lead satisfying lives? Positive institutions share several features (<span class="citation" id="SPNLJBMUJQD1X6XDD872" id-sequence="1237">Peterson, 2006</span>). They share a purpose in the form of institutional goals. Their rules and consequences are fair. They feature a reciprocal caring by the institution for its members and by the members for the institution. A positive institution provides safety for its members and treats them with respect.</p> <p id="RVDNJEMX48Q3VHTAW821" id-sequence="1238">One of your goals in completing a college education is probably related to the type of work you’ll be able to do as a result. Your future working conditions will have significant<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_681" data-page="681"></a> influence on your overall well-being. Positive psychologists have identified three ways that people feel about their work (<span class="citation" id="CKMX7PM5S926DLY7Y691" id-sequence="1239">Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, &amp; Schwartz, 1997</span>). Some people just have jobs. A job is viewed as a way of supporting your family, and workers with jobs emphasize this role without asking more of their work life. A career not only pays the bills but also fulfills workers’ needs for status and achievement. Finally, a calling satisfies both personal and cooperative goals. The worker pays the bills while gaining both personal achievement and a sense of contributing to the community. When workers view their employment as a calling, they are less concerned with work conditions, salary, benefits, and status. Positive workplaces facilitate the workers’ abilities to meet their personal work-related goals.</p> <div class="figure" id="HSAHDHSSGPUVG3QN9275" id-sequence="1240"> <div class="heading"><div class="caption" id="FUPWENFSQN1V6Q4SA449" id-sequence="1241"><p><em>Forbes</em> rankings of “best employers” for 2016 cover a wide variety of industries.

In a manner similar to psychology’s emphasis on disorders, most of the research in education has focused on what goes wrong in schools rather than on what schools are doing well. Positive schools promote growth and produce a sense of satisfaction in students. Although this area is sparsely studied, student satisfaction with schools predicts a number of positive outcomes, including higher grades and fewer problem behaviors, even as early as kindergarten (<span class="citation" id="KXFT7WY6BYJ8SWCDA261" id-sequence="1261">Ladd, Buhs, &amp; Seid, 2000</span>).</p> <p id="FGZV4LP6JCFAU27B5644" id-sequence="1262">Significant challenges face today’s families, and identifying what works could provide guidance for many.

Although research indicates that optimism and health are linked, this finding might give sick people the unfortunate impression that all they have to do to cure their illness is to maintain a positive attitude. A second criticism is related to the integration theme that we have featured in this textbook. Positive strengths are valuable, but they are best studied within the entire context of individuals interacting in environments. Positive and negative emotions can coexist, and we cannot fully understand one type of experience without considering the other (Cacioppo, Berntson, Norris, &amp; Gollan, 2011).</p> <p id="KTBL8ZXLZMHERZ0UL217" id-sequence="1274">It is unlikely that psychology will ever abandon its goal of helping troubled people feel better, but positive psychology’s emphasis on what goes right is also illuminating. We do not know at this time whether the label of positive psychology will drop out of favor, like Wilhelm Wundt’s structuralism, or enjoy the fate of William James’s functionalism by becoming so integrated into mainstream psychology that a label is no longer necessary. By applying the same evidence-based criteria that we have described for evaluating interventions for “negative” behaviors to interventions based on positive psychology, we will figure out the role that positive psychology should play in our continued search for understanding the human mind.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_682" data-page="682"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_interpersonalrelationships narrative  rs_skip" id="ADDJCVZ696F3HVSNW632" label="interpersonalrelationships" id-sequence="1275"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Interpersonal Relationships</span><h3 id="SRMZHFCNE8ZT4LKWX292" id-sequence="1276">The Health Psychology Perspective</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="ADDJCVZ696F3HVSNW632_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1277"> <div class="pageSection" id="NEEGY4WT7H75M4SNJ268" id-sequence="1278"> <h3 id="AWXAT778XP8CAHMQA088" id-sequence="1279"><span class="headingText">How do Investment and Experiences of Gratitude Affect Relationships?</span></h3> <p id="ULAL33JCLD4T1MKV6374" id-sequence="1280">We have studied relationships from the vantage points of 15 psychological perspectives so far in this textbook, and we end the journey with an analysis of the role of a positive emotion—gratitude—on relationship building.</p> <p id="RWHN9K5ACJ3FRM3VP268" id-sequence="1281">Psychologists traditionally have focused on how an individual invests in relationships and report that individuals’ perceptions of how much they have already invested (time, energy, and other resources) influences how committed they feel. However, researchers know relatively little about how our perceptions of our partner’s investment in the relationship influence our commitment.</p> <p id="RYCEAG993YXANP2GN833" id-sequence="1282">When a partner invests in a relationship, the typical response is the experience of the positive emotion of gratitude. Gratitude includes the feelings of thankfulness and appreciation felt for the partner, which in turn affects the perception of who the partner is as a person (<span class="citation" id="NCZVNK1BT3H6GGYKA043" id-sequence="1283">Joel, Gordon, Impett, MacDonald, &amp; Keltner, 2013</span>). When people experience gratitude for a partner, it stimulates further commitment. The amount of commitment that an individual experiences is linked to the perceived investment in the relationship on the part of the partner.</p> <p id="HRESJZR5NK13G97VM714" id-sequence="1284">What types of investment promote more gratitude, and through those feelings, greater commitment? You might guess that financial investments would be important, but research has shown that intangible investments, like emotional involvement, have a greater impact on commitment (Goodfriend &amp; Agnew, 2008). This is reminiscent of the finding discussed earlier that it is not wealth that makes us happy, but rather our social connectivity.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1818 rs_skip" id="ZEYXDPC0DVG9BMC6A197" clrenderdata="[&quot;CXNU1BYXQLB7HW3F2410&quot;]" id-sequence="1285"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_16_unf42-t2.jpg" data-width="232" data-height="326" data-alt="A photo shows a pregnant woman reclining on a bed, and a man in the foreground with a tray having two croissants, a pretzel, a small coffee mug, and a glass cup with sliced fruits."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="FXAFB77T0LC9Z65AT995" id-sequence="1286"><p>It’s often the little things that people do for their partners that result in gratitude and a stronger commitment to the relationship.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:232px;height:326px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_16_unf42-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows a pregnant woman reclining on a bed, and a man in the foreground with a tray having two croissants, a pretzel, a small coffee mug, and a glass cup with sliced fruits." width="232" height="326" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Matthias Tunger/Corbis </div> </div></div></div> </div> </div></div> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologytakesonrealworldproblems narrative  rs_skip" id="TLDBQN8GUD6V3RMP6034" label="psychologytakesonrealworldproblems" id-sequence="1287"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Psychology Takes on Real-World Problems</span><h3 id="JBSG0JF6UWWJUQWAM502" id-sequence="1288">Building Resilience in Youth Exposed to Cyberbullying</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="TLDBQN8GUD6V3RMP6034_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="1289"> <p id="EUNY6H8DU55SWKD8L341" id-sequence="1290">In sections in the previous chapters, we have focused more on the perpetrators of cyberbullying than the victims.

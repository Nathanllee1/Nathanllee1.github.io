About 5% of the population experience stuttering (Månsson, 2000), with males two to five times more likely to stutter than females (<span class="citation" id="PDWFGZFEA4VN59SW5021" id-sequence="33">Craig &amp; Tran, 2005</span>).</p> <p id="KXNWQCFS3HUS2KAX4953" id-sequence="34">Stuttering has been described since the days of the ancient Greeks and occurs across all cultures and ethnicities. Many interesting myths exist regarding its causes and remedies (<span class="citation" id="BYSJSLJBYPTTABQMF891" id-sequence="35">Kuster, 2005</span>). South African traditions suggest that stuttering results from leaving a baby out in the rain or tickling the infant too much. A Chinese folk remedy for stuttering was to hit the person in the face when the weather was cloudy. In Iceland, people believed that a pregnant woman who drank from a cracked cup was likely to produce a child who stuttered.</p> <p id="WMYUVH4VBAZXDLE33314" id-sequence="36">Many of us might ask, “How could anybody believe these things?” But how do we know these are merely myths and not facts? Instead of dismissing these efforts to explain and predict, think about what might have happened to lead people to these particular conclusions. What is missing from these conclusions is a system for reaching logical, objective results. Science provides us with this system.</p> <p id="PNHM1AD8B43GLWAKR429" id-sequence="37">What does science have to say about stuttering? Based on the careful evaluation of stuttering using the methods outlined in this chapter, scientists have concluded that there are multiple causes for stuttering (<span class="citation" id="GAMAE37LZS67SHU65265" id-sequence="38">Kang et al., 2010</span>). Many cases seem to have a basis in genetics, which is discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-chapter-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455" data-element-id="TPPAPQFA7W5XFGWW3455">Chapter 3</a> (<span class="citation" id="KXSQ59W6QHBDTACUS756" id-sequence="39">Raza et al., 2015</span>). Scientists have used brain-imaging technologies to zoom in on brain structures and<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_33" data-page="33"></a> functions that appear to differ between stutterers and fluent speakers, with stutterers showing more activation of the right hemisphere during speech (<span class="citation" id="EJLM8PQE2G1PVLFDP675" id-sequence="40">Gordon, 2002</span>). As mentioned in the previous chapter, some of the most thorough explanations combine multiple psychological perspectives (<span class="citation" id="RZFWU8VAU12BGZ5PX107" id-sequence="41">Ward, 2013</span>). A complete explanation of stuttering zooms back out to combine a predisposition for the problem resulting from genetics and biology with developmental, emotional, and social factors, like feeling embarrassed or anxious about speaking in front of peers.</p> <p id="VXGRP43WYHM37B9JD235" id-sequence="42">Although there is no “cure” for stuttering, carefully tested scientific explanations combining input from various perspectives are leading to more effective treatments. In this chapter, you will learn how science provides a system that allows us to construct increasingly realistic models of the world around us.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1401 rs_skip" id="VUDH2UQG6M6REHABF947" clrenderdata="[&quot;MANYKSKPG8HTLHBT8463&quot;]" id-sequence="43"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="365" data-height="235" data-alt="Science has provided explanations for many natural phenomena, like lightning, that were probably quite frightening for our ancestors."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="MVNX59Y9Z1CF06A4D835" id-sequence="44"><p>Science has provided explanations for many natural phenomena, like lightning, that were probably quite frightening for our ancestors.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:365px;height:235px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_02_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Science has provided explanations for many natural phenomena, like lightning, that were probably quite frightening for our ancestors." width="365" height="235" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">steineranden/ <a target="_blank" id="YRXCA3NJHA1Q4Q4CB323" name="YRXCA3NJHA1Q4Q4CB323" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="45">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> </div><div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="46"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="49"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="50" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="51" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="DBDE08A72LKFPGQP4291" id-sequence="52"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">2-1</span> <span class="headingText">What Is Science?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="ZSGHWP5RH17L9N82R349_content" id-sequence="53"> <p id="CTUCN2F4273U6D4KG527" id-sequence="54">Throughout human history, we have been motivated to understand, predict, and control the world around us.

</span> means that conclusions are based on facts, without influence from personal emotions or biases. In contrast, <em>subjectivity</em> means that conclusions reflect personal points of view. In a study by Allport and Postman (1945), research participants described what they had heard about photos from memory. Some participants switched the race of a man threatening another person from White (which was the objective fact in the photo) to Black, possibly to fit a biased, subjective worldview.</p> <p id="YCRAPXX8KP1EHASNC686" id-sequence="76">Scientists strive to be objective, but any observation by a human is, by definition, subjective. Recognizing when we are being subjective can be difficult, so scientists cannot rely on their introspections to maintain objectivity. Most of us have had the experience of witnessing an accident in the presence of other people. It can be astonishing to hear the different accounts of what happened. Didn’t we all see the same thing? Individuals<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_34" data-page="34"></a> like to believe that their own view of the events is the accurate one. As discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-element-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">10</a>, objective facts can be altered easily when processed subjectively by individuals. The scientific methods described in this chapter promote objectivity and help prevent biased, subjective observations from distorting a scientist’s work.</p> <p id="SJRFS2MGNV2UT0BHZ729" id-sequence="77">The second important difference between science and everyday observations is the use of systematic as opposed to hit-or-miss observation. By “hit or miss,” we mean making conclusions based only on whatever is happening around us. If we want to make conclusions about the human mind, we cannot restrict our observations to our immediate circle of acquaintances, friends, and loved ones. Our observations of the people we see frequently are probably quite valid. It’s just that the people we know represent a small slice of the greater population. For example, we might be surprised to learn that our favorite candidate lost an election because “everyone we know” voted for that candidate.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1403 rs_skip" id="YFMDKQVABCYX87AAC303" clrenderdata="[&quot;FASM8VXMNJGC196W8676&quot;]" id-sequence="78"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf04-t2.png" data-width="547" data-height="387" data-alt="A cartoon shows people in a subway.

We can see why a college student might believe this after making hit-or-miss observations. Among 18- to 22-year-olds enrolled in college, nearly two-thirds reported binge drinking in the previous 30 days (NIAAA, 2015). In contrast, the overall prevalence of binge drinking at least once in the past year among U.S. adults was 24.9%, and the rate among all young adults between 18 and 24 years was 33.4% (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FKNE2314HSXK3LA53659" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="LPAH1PKB4FUJHRGCV833" data-element-id="FKNE2314HSXK3LA53659">Figure 2.1</a>), well below the frequency observed among those in college (CDC, 2016).

Careful scientific studies have called into question the belief that women talk more than men.

Most change occurs slowly on the cutting edges of science, not quickly or at the main core of its knowledge base. Unlike with many other fields, we expect science to improve over time.

So far as we can tell, the study was never published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (a huge weakness), but it was written up by a number of blogs. The best report was a description in the USC Annenberg’s <em>Online Journalism Review</em> (<span class="citation" id="LEXWL6UN2XGZDUS53242" id-sequence="148">Ruel, 2007</span>). Ruel’s report noted that the 255 participants between the ages of 18 and 64, 58% female and 42% male, looked for different lengths of time at parts of a photo of baseball player George Brett while undergoing eye-tracking analysis. In addition, when asked to browse the American Kennel Club website, the Nielsen/Norman researchers found that men fixated longer on the dogs’ genitalia than the women did.</p></div> </li> <li id="BFGGTQ5AU88EKLCG7183" id-sequence="149"> <p id="LRFURYQXE85H7P708742" id-sequence="150">Are There Other Ways That This Evidence Could Be Interpreted?</p> <div class="answer" id="KLYCLPN1P9UVTLB99958" tabindex="-1" id-sequence="151"><span class="answerHeading">Answer</span><p id="HKGLGNR8AR4837A71583" id-sequence="152"><strong>Our answer:</strong> Eye-tracking data, handled well, can be an excellent research tool. However, we don’t know much about how fixation length was calculated by Nielsen/Norman. We don’t know if the “heat map” image in Cracked is from a single participant or represents an average of viewer responses. Although the image seems clear (women or a single female participant fixated only on the head and shoulders area), psychologists would usually want a quantitative measure of a supposed difference between two groups.

We would want to ensure that the Nielsen/Norman sample was truly representative before making such a claim. One of the biggest weaknesses in the interpretation of these data is the use of two types of stimuli—a photo of George Brett and photos of dogs. A much wider selection of stimuli would help us understand if a general principle were involved or whether people were just reacting to these particular stimuli.</p></div> </li> <li id="QHQC3Y33GFGRHPSS9227" id-sequence="157"> <p id="NQEA6DZY5UJYZCQXJ519" id-sequence="158">What Are the Most Reasonable Conclusions?</p> <div class="answer" id="AFZFERP4T7PZHBXNE543" tabindex="-1" id-sequence="159"><span class="answerHeading">Answer</span><p id="QAGFZTWAQLZTJ5N36715" id-sequence="160"><strong>Our answer:</strong> While the result presented by <a target="_blank" id="KDWHX490P74UZSQE1568" name="KDWHX490P74UZSQE1568" class="external" href="http://Cracked.com" id-sequence="161">Cracked.com</a> is entertaining, which is the purpose of the website, it does not represent good science.

In other words, scientists construct the best possible models of reality based on the facts known to date. Unfortunately, the English language can be the source of considerable confusion regarding the nature of scientific theories. In addition to its use in science, the word <em>theory</em> can be used in nonscientific ways to describe a guess, such as “I have a theory about why my professor seems unusually cheerful this morning,” or a hypothetical situation, as in “That’s the theory, but it may not work in practice.” Confusion over the multiple meanings of the word <em>theory</em> have led people mistakenly to view truly scientific theories, like the theory of evolution, as nothing more than casual guesses or hunches, rather than the thoroughly investigated and massively supported principles that they are.</p> <p id="NLPK65MYT16SY4PXN772" id-sequence="189">The best scientific theories not only explain and organize known facts, but also generate new predictions (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="TCBH10H7LAGEXHL6U356" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="FDQBMU4QL12UKK43N334" data-element-id="TCBH10H7LAGEXHL6U356">Figure 2.3</a>). The word <em>prediction</em> comes from the Latin words for “saying before.” A scientific prediction is more than a guess or hunch. It is usually stated in a rigorous, mathematical form that allows the scientist to say that under a certain set of circumstances, a certain set of outcomes are likely to occur (if A, then B). In some cases, a theory’s predictions can be surprising. For example, you might believe that it’s impossible to be happy and sad at the same time. However, one model of emotion, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapter 7</a>, predicted that it is quite possible to feel happy and sad at the same time (<span class="citation" id="NEHF8T2ZVKSL8TN6Y036" id-sequence="190">Cacioppo, Berntson, Norris, &amp; Gollan, 2012</span>).

A scientist producing the original data might want to double-check his or her results, or other scientists might want to see if they can produce the same results (<span class="citation" id="WWDNUEDYUVHR8WC2P257" id-sequence="222">Simons, 2014</span>). What happens if a study fails to replicate?</p> <p id="TPKZRCQLEMT2N017F721" id-sequence="223">When a group of nearly 300 psychologists led by Brian Nosek, known as the Open Science Collaboration (OSC), set out to replicate 100 studies from three well-respected psychology journals, the results were not encouraging (Nosek, et al., 2015). Only 36% of the replications produced significant results, meaning that the researchers were unable to duplicate the original findings of the studies the majority of the time. The average effect size, or the strength of a phenomenon, in the replications was only about half of that reported in the original studies. In other words, if a study found that 50% of the difference in physical aggressiveness was due to hot weather, the replication might show that only about 25% of the difference in aggressiveness was accounted for by the weather. Does this mean that we have to throw out these results?</p> <p id="PYQFTWEWTA36XU8XK651" id-sequence="224">While failure to replicate should give any scientist a reason to reflect on his or her results, other psychologists are not particularly alarmed by the findings of Nosek and his colleagues (<span class="citation" id="HFVXWDR5NUN2ZDNK0037" id-sequence="225">Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016</span>). The methods used in the replication efforts were often different from the original study. For example, a sample of Italians substituted for Americans in a study of attitudes toward African Americans and a study of college students being called on by a professor was replicated with people who had not attended college. These differences in sampling, rather than the validity of the original study, might have been the key reason for finding different outcomes.</p> <p id="RAQCS11ACWNJT0E1H756" id-sequence="226">Scientific debates usually move us in the right direction. Regardless of how big a replication problem psychology might or might not have, psychologists are looking for new methods to make their results even more reliable. For example, submitting a public “registered report” of the methods and statistical analyses that a researcher plans to run <em>prior</em> to conducting a study discourages any after-the-fact efforts to tweak data and results to find something interesting when the main purpose of the study fails. Sharing data, detailed methods, and results in public places allows others to evaluate a researcher’s findings. Addressing unrealistic pressure on academics to “publish or perish” and putting quality of research ahead of quantity should also contribute to a more robust scientific environment.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf140d rs_skip" id="LHLMALTMWA5WV75E3166" clrenderdata="[&quot;YXKJYN8MGG9PQK11U736&quot;]" id-sequence="227"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf10-t2.jpg" data-width="345" data-height="250" data-alt="A photo shows hands with soap under running water."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="HAUV1K8XQTH2TM4DG080" id-sequence="228"><p>One of the studies cited frequently in psychology’s replication crisis is a 2008 paper by Schnall, Benton, and Harvey that reported that handwashing reduced the severity of participants’ moral judgments.

Descriptive methods, including surveys, case studies, and observations, provide a good starting place for a new research question. Correlational methods help psychologists see how two variables of interest, like the number of hours spent playing video games and level of physical aggression, relate to each other. Psychologists use experiments to test their hypotheses and to determine the causes of behavior.</p> <p id="AEZCUR41ZFS7DJ0UH666" id-sequence="277">In the next sections, we will describe the common research methods used in psychological science and then compare how they might be used to approach a particular question—whether exposure to video game violence increases aggression. Each method—descriptive, correlational, and experimental—provides a different view of the phenomenon in question, and each has a particular profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each requires different types of statistical analyses, which are described in more depth later in the chapter. Many psychological studies combine several of these methods.

</span> provides an in-depth analysis of the behavior of one person or a small number of people. Many fields, including medicine, law, and business, use the case study method. Psychologists often use case studies when large numbers of participants are not available or when a particular participant possesses unique characteristics, as in the case described in this section. Interviews, background records, observation, personality tests, cognitive tests, and brain imaging provide information necessary to evaluate the case. Case studies not only are a useful source of hypotheses, but also can be used to test hypotheses. If you did a case study on a planet outside our solar system and discovered life there, you would disprove a hypothesis that no life exists outside our solar system.</p> <p id="GWMGXXT0HNGD5C5J8860" id-sequence="294">One of the most productive case studies in psychology chronicled more than 50 years of examinations of Henry Molaison (1926–2008), known in the scientific literature as “the amnesiac patient H.M.” In 1953, Molaison underwent brain surgery to control his frequent, severe seizures. Although the surgery may have saved his life, he was left with profound memory deficits, which are described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-chapter-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946" data-element-id="BZTD4SLT399WRK8ST946">Chapter 9</a>. Through painstaking testing and evaluation of Molaison, psychologists learned a great deal about the brain structures and processes that support the formation of memories (<span class="citation" id="QTFZ5PBG5PB182JYC002" id-sequence="295">Corkin, 2002</span>). Even after his death, Molaison continues to contribute to our knowledge.

You could conduct a case study of Michael Carneal, who was sentenced to life in prison after he began shooting students at his high school in West Paducah, Kentucky, killing three students and seriously wounding five others. He had never shot a real gun before, but he was fond of playing first-person-shooter games like <em>Doom</em>. To conduct your case study, you gather background facts about Carneal’s case, possibly by interviewing others associated with the case, viewing legal and medical documents, and observing media accounts. You interview Carneal and possibly administer established personality and clinical tests like those discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapters 12</a> and <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-chapter-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551" data-element-id="RAHA4KC8R3R54RMWE551">15</a>.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf140e rs_skip" id="BREX9WP6F1SKYE5QY928" clrenderdata="[&quot;MDWZLNQA8WBAEP0QG999&quot;]" id-sequence="297"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf11-t2.jpg" data-width="560" data-height="582" data-alt="One of the most famous case studies in psychology is that of Henry Molaison (left), who was known in the literature as “the amnesic patient H.M.” until his death in 2008.

Mass shooters are thankfully quite rare, and the case study method is well suited to learning about unusual situations. A case study can contribute to science by testing hypotheses. If a hypothesis made a strong prediction that all mass shooters play violent video games, finding and documenting a case of a mass shooter who did not play violent video games would require rejection of the hypothesis. Based on the detailed data that you obtain from Carneal’s case, you will be better prepared to generate and test additional hypotheses.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_42" data-page="42"></a> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="DYVJ1YSFX29RPW4AM159" id-sequence="300"> <h3 id="KDCEVULEJHKYBK1WJ985" id-sequence="301"><span class="headingText">Naturalistic Observation</span></h3> <p id="SWAFZ720QXFCX1XLX647" id-sequence="302">If you are interested in learning about larger groups of people than are possible with the case study method, you might pursue <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e28" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e28"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e28" id="DHQZ30MUDP9XP04KU814" id-sequence="303"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">naturalistic observation</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="ETDCKQWQMSYVAJU1L499" id-sequence="304">naturalistic observation</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">An in-depth study of a phenomenon in its natural setting.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e28">

In the summer of 1960, Goodall, then 26 years old, began her painstaking observations of chimpanzees living in Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Among her discoveries was that chimpanzees were not vegetarians, as previously assumed (<span class="citation" id="BXNJ3MCFCQ0LFMBJ2264" id-sequence="308">Goodall, 1971</span>, p. 34):</p> <div class="excerpt" id="YYXZJQ968EQS930QU915" id-sequence="309"> <p id="VVQLTUMFX8D5FR1KD256" id-sequence="310">I saw that one of them was holding a pink-looking object from which he was from time to time pulling pieces with his teeth. There was a female and a youngster and they were both reaching out toward the male, their hands actually touching his mouth. Presently the female picked up a piece of the pink thing and put it to her mouth: it was at this moment that I realized the chimps were eating meat.</p> </div> <p id="DPLQPTZLLNJ1DC7A2095" id-sequence="311">As a result of Goodall’s years spent following the chimpanzees, scientists have a rich, accurate knowledge of the behavior of these animals in the wild.</p> <p id="ZFYBEYPXQS0ZC1H1Q070" id-sequence="312">Impressed by Goodall’s results, you plan to pursue further knowledge about violent video games and aggression by attending local area network (LAN) parties, where attendees bring their computers to a gathering place to play multiplayer, networked video games. You hope that by observing people playing violent video games and watching their subsequent behavior for signs of aggression, you might reach some conclusions about the relationships between video game violence and aggression. As in Goodall’s case, this approach has the advantages of providing insight into natural, real-world behaviors with large numbers of participants.</p> <p id="KEZGQN2XJ7RW8584R821" id-sequence="313">Some naturalistic observations are conducted when people know that they are being observed, while in other cases, people are unaware of being observed. Both situations raise challenges. If we know we are being observed, we might act differently. Your LAN party participants know that aggression is not viewed positively in our culture, so they might act less aggressively when they know that they’re being watched. Watching people who do not know that they’re being watched raises ethical issues, which will be explored later in this chapter. How would you feel if you discovered that you had been an unwitting participant in a study?</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1410 rs_skip" id="WTBP5A1VZ0FKZTXFJ063" clrenderdata="[&quot;EHHHFK4VZJTEN3A2K949&quot;]" id-sequence="314"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf13-t2.jpg" data-width="228" data-height="276" data-alt="A photo shows Jane Goodall sitting and bending down toward a baby chimpanzee seated on the ground."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="UVQKAU7UDHMV8KRVP634" id-sequence="315"><p>Jane Goodall used naturalistic observation to illuminate the world of the chimpanzee.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:228px;height:276px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_02_unf13-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A photo shows Jane Goodall sitting and bending down toward a baby chimpanzee seated on the ground." width="228" height="276" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Avalon/Bruce Coleman Inc/Alamy Stock Photo </div> </div></div></div> <p id="VRPVDQ4UQZN41UA4L438" id-sequence="316">The use of naturalistic observation illustrates the importance of choosing a method that is well suited to the research goals. Like the case study method, naturalistic observation can be helpful for developing hypotheses, but other methods must be used to test them. Most hypotheses in psychology look at the relationships between two or more concepts, like the exposure to violent video games and aggression in this example. Testing a hypothesis would allow you to say whether a relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression exists, how strong the relationship is, what direction it goes in, and so on. It might appear to you that the people you observe are more aggressive following their LAN parties, but you have no way to demonstrate your point. People engage in lots of behaviors during LAN parties. Perhaps eating pizza or staying up all night at LAN parties enhances aggressive tendencies. With only your naturalistic observations to go on, you can’t say for sure.</p> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="ZQRNGTL1QMYGDS7G2515" id-sequence="317"> <h3 id="MZPQS78VE059ZJY16706" id-sequence="318"><span class="headingText">The Survey</span></h3> <p id="QUKC2H7R6UGHLRFX0163" id-sequence="319"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e29" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e29"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e29" id="TPXNT66PH7XX099E9181" id-sequence="320"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Surveys</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="MGHEREZNVLV7GCLY4041" id-sequence="321">Surveys</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A descriptive method in which participants are asked the same questions</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e29">

</span> answers the simple question of “how much” of a variable we have observed. After we obtain measures of each variable, we compare the values of one variable to those of the other and conduct a statistical analysis of the results. Three possible outcomes from the comparison between our two variables can occur: positive, negative, or zero correlation. In a positive correlation, high levels of one variable are associated with high levels of the other. Height and weight usually show this type of relationship. In most cases, people who are taller weigh more than people who are shorter. Two variables also can show a negative correlation, in which high values of one variable are associated with low values of another. For example, high levels of alcohol consumption among college students are usually associated with low GPAs. The third possible outcome is a zero correlation, in which the two variables have no systematic relationship with each other. When variables have a zero correlation, knowing the value of one variable does not tell us anything about the value of the other (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="USBXW612CAEQX9CDM939" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="JPFCLR7K4JG5QRZ3N292" data-element-id="USBXW612CAEQX9CDM939">Figure 2.6</a>). For example, emergency room and law enforcement personnel are often convinced that they are busier with emergencies and crime on nights with a full moon. In contrast, numerous scientific studies of lunar cycles show zero correlation with emergency room admissions, traffic accidents, or other types of trauma (Stomp, ten Duis, &amp; Nijsten, 2011).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1414 rs_skip" id="CKHWRX1WXNXN25KDG514" clrenderdata="[&quot;NXAQJMKT61KX30GA4033&quot;]" id-sequence="366"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf16-t2.png" data-width="311" data-height="276" data-alt="A photo shows a young man checking the option agree under your opinion on a virtual glass board.

Let us say that we discover a positive correlation between violent video games and aggression: Youth who play the most hours of violent video games have the most reports of physical aggression at school.

First, the two variables in a correlation can influence each other simultaneously.

For example, a researcher might want to test the effects of aerobic exercise on blood pressure. If some participants competed in triathlons without the researcher’s knowledge, their athletic experience would confound the interpretation of the results. Random assignment to groups typically controls for confounds because of these types of individual differences, but other sources of confounds exist. Situational confounds, such as time of day or noise levels in a laboratory, also could affect the interpretation of an experiment. Scientists attempt to run their experiments under the most constant circumstances possible to rule out situational confounding variables.</p> <p id="DGYU2H9F0H3YCSLRQ407" id-sequence="417">Let’s return to our question about violent video games and aggression and see how one real experiment addressed the issue. The researchers tested a hypothesis stating that playing video games varying in violent content (the independent variable) would influence subsequent levels of aggression (the dependent variable; see <span class="citation" id="XSUYZBC2NS2YC12KY292" id-sequence="418"> Anderson &amp; Dill, 2000</span>). The experimental group played a violent game (<em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>), while the control group played a nonviolent game (<em>Myst</em>). Participants were randomly assigned to groups. You can imagine how the results might be distorted if the experimental group consisted of football players and the control group consisted of members of the chess club. Following their game-playing, participants had an opportunity to choose the intensity and duration for a blast of noise to punish a remotely located loser (who didn’t exist) in a competitive reaction time activity, and their choices served as the dependent variable. We’re assuming that laboratory conditions were held constant to avoid situational confounds. For example, we know that people feel more aggressive in hot temperatures (<span class="citation" id="CDUY4ELM1QXDFPVLH829" id-sequence="419">Carlsmith &amp; Anderson, 1979</span>). What would happen to our experiment if the air<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_48" data-page="48"></a> conditioner in the laboratory broke while some participants played violent video games, but was fixed right before the next participants played nonviolent games?

Experiments can be somewhat artificial. Participants know that they are in a research study, and they may vary their behavior as a result. However, making a laboratory experiment more realistic can raise ethical challenges. In a study conducted in 1962, before current ethical guidelines for research had been adopted, military personnel were led to believe that their lives were in danger so that experimenters could realistically assess the effects of panic on performance (<span class="citation" id="SJEG1KHFRMSXLE1QS697" id-sequence="424">Berkun, Bialek, Kern, &amp; Yagi, 1962</span>).

</span>. The first step in operationalization is to identify the concept to be measured clearly, such as the violence in a video game. Next, the quantitative measures of the concept must be determined. What measures do you need to tell a violent video game from a nonviolent one? You might develop a rating scale based on the number of times violent images, such as depictions of physical injury or blood, are presented in a particular game. Finally, a method for obtaining this measure must be developed. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) uses a panel of trained raters to evaluate a DVD of representative game-play submitted by a manufacturer of a new game to establish an appropriate age group rating (ESRB, 2014).</p> <p id="DJEN2N2VGKNB8HVLS426" id-sequence="433">There are many ways to operationalize variables in practical terms. Anderson and Dill (2000) operationalized aggression in terms of how lengthy and loud a sound blast a person was willing to inflict on another person. One of the odder dependent variables used in video game aggression research is the hot sauce paradigm, in which the amounts of hot sauce that participants choose to be administered to another participant are used to measure aggression (<span class="citation" id="TRPDE571GUAVC5S88155" id-sequence="434">Lieberman, Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; McGregor, 1999</span>). Other researchers might choose different ways to operationalize aggression, such as frequency of physical fights among preschoolers. As a result, even though there is a large body of work regarding the impact of violent video games on aggression, the variables used are so different that few direct comparisons can be made among the many studies.</p> <div class="pageSection" id="VBBFR2K4MH31JDVMS021" id-sequence="435"> <h3 id="AZHYYVC87K3XJXNWU008" id-sequence="436"><span class="headingText">Meta-analyses</span></h3> <p id="TQQQBENRLNC9BYJ0Z602" id-sequence="437">The point of this discussion is not to convince you that scientists don’t know what they’re talking about, but rather to impress upon you the importance of reviewing research results using your best critical thinking skills.

In one careful study, young children were given drinks that either had no additives (placebo) or a combination of colorings and preservatives used frequently in packaged foods (McCann, et al., 2007). Because it was a double-blind study, the children did not know which drink they had received, and the researchers responsible for observing the children did not know which drink had been served to each child. The outcome of this study showed that general measures of hyperactivity, or unusually large amounts of movement, were higher in the groups that had consumed the additives than in the group that had consumed the placebo.

</span>, we might gather groups of people of varying ages and assess both their exposure to violent video games and their levels of physical aggression. We might be able to plot a developmental course for age-related differences in both video game exposure and aggressive behavior. However, the cross-sectional method introduces what we refer to as <em>cohort effects</em>, or the generational effects of having been born at a particular point in history. Being 20 years old in 1959 was different from being 20 years old in 1989 or 2019 because of a variety of cultural influences. Today’s 10-year-olds, who do not know of a time without the Internet, might respond differently to violent video games than today’s 50-year-olds, for reasons that have nothing to do with age. Any such cohort effects could mask or distort our cross-sectional results.</p> <div class="container dependent margin narrative  rs_skip" id="NDYCGFTUT9T4PT3FM276" id-sequence="483"><div class="sidebarContent" id="NDYCGFTUT9T4PT3FM276_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="484"> <p id="YPHBVMW6QQJ955BR3225" id-sequence="485">Cross-sectional studies usually show that intelligence scores decrease with age.

For example, the Fels Longitudinal Study began in 1929 to observe the effects of the Great Depression on children, and it now has enrolled great-grandchildren of the original participants. To use the longitudinal method to answer our question, we could start with a group of infants and carefully plot their exposure to violent video games and their levels of physical aggression into adulthood. The longitudinal approach has few logical drawbacks but is expensive and time consuming. Participants drop out of the study because of moves or lack of incentive. Researchers then must worry about whether those who remain in the study still comprise a representative sample.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1420 rs_skip" id="RRRM89KTQCMKMJ7ET950" clrenderdata="[&quot;PNQM25GCWUYMQZUAM468&quot;]" id-sequence="489"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_f12-t2.png" data-width="477" data-height="261" data-alt="A line graph shows the change in mean T scores of verbal memory, verbal ability, and perceptual speed as age increases.

        <span class="pointer"></span>
    </span>
</span> refers to the consistency of a measure. There are several meanings of reliability in science, including test–retest, interrater, inter-method, and internal consistency. For example, test–retest reliability of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is quite good, as you might have noticed if you took the test more than once. If you were ill for the first test, or you invested in a preparation course before taking it the second time, your score might change; otherwise, your scores are likely to be about the same. Good measures also show high <em>interrater reliability</em>, or consistency in the interpretation of a measure across different observers. You can imagine how distressing it would be if, for example, one lab identified you as having a fatal disease on the basis of a blood test and another did not. Inter-method reliability describes the positive correlation of several approaches to measure a feature in an individual. Returning to the SAT example, it is likely that your SAT and high school grades are positively correlated, which supports the reliability of these measures. Finally, internal consistency results from measures within a single test that positively correlate with one another.</p> <p id="MYXUW1L1FEST92ADG150" id-sequence="604"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e40" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e40"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e40" id="KQZGFZDZF7XL30A0J237" id-sequence="605"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Validity</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="CFDPE5HTJ5WDP1U59046" id-sequence="606">Validity</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A quality of a measure that leads to correct conclusions (i.e., the measure evaluates the concept that it was designed to do).</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e40">

        <span class="pointer"></span>
    </span>
</span> means that a measure leads to correct conclusions or evaluates the concept that it is designed to do. For example, your bathroom scale is supposed to measure how much you weigh. The data obtained from your bathroom scale can lead you to a valid conclusion (this is how much I weigh) or an invalid conclusion (wow, I’m much lighter than the doctor’s scale said I am).</p> <p id="SJJZM4E2AB5YCZDRG216" id-sequence="607">How would we determine whether a measure leads to valid conclusions? One approach is to see whether a measure correlates with other existing, established measures of the same concept. Many universities use the SAT to help select the best candidates for admission. This test is supposed to measure a student’s aptitude for success in college, but some universities have abandoned it in favor of other measures. We could ask which of the following measures—the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, or high school GPA—shows the highest positive correlation with first-year college grades. The results of this comparison indicate that the SAT Subject Tests show the highest positive correlation with first-year college grades compared to both the SAT and the high school GPA (<span class="citation" id="RCAJPT0NVSQ3M1MPA700" id-sequence="608">Geiser &amp; Studley, 2001</span>). Thus, we can conclude that SAT Subject Tests are the most valid of the three measures for predicting first-year college grades.</p> <p id="BHKACUESTPN4F7H28510" id-sequence="609">Reliability and validity are not the same. You can obtain a consistent result (reliability) that lacks meaning (validity), but a measure cannot be valid without also being reliable. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds and your bathroom scale consistently reports that you weigh 150 pounds, whether you’re looking at the number or your roommate reads it for you, the scale has reliability but not validity. If you get a wildly different number each time you step on the scale, you have neither reliability nor validity. The measure is not consistent (no reliability) and also fails to measure the construct—weight in this case—that it is designed to measure (no validity).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="610"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="613"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="614" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="615" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="CYNB71B2U8HQPHU1D236" id-sequence="616"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">2-3b</span> <span class="headingText">Descriptive Statistics</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="ZYXE4YCM8S7K91TAX982_content" id-sequence="617"> <p id="HAGERUARWNQJ30P0S056" id-sequence="618">Just as we might explore a new research topic using the descriptive research methods outlined earlier, we can use descriptive statistics to explore the characteristics of the data obtained from<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_54" data-page="54"></a> our research. <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e41" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e41"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e41" id="KLHF7F54RZ5VR0J27976" id-sequence="619"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Descriptive statistics</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="FLTB0WL4VYDT792KF598" id-sequence="620">Descriptive statistics</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Statistical methods that organize data into meaningful patterns and summaries, such as finding the average value.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e41">

</span> help us organize individual bits of data into meaningful patterns and summaries. For example, research investigating the ability of the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, and high school grades to predict grades in colleges and universities across the country would be overwhelming without some way of summarizing the individual data points for tens of thousands of students in meaningful ways. Descriptive data tell us only about the sample we have studied.

    </span>
</span> represents a halfway mark in the data set, with half of the scores above it and half below. The median is far less affected by extreme scores, or outliers, than the mean. In our SAT data, the median scores—500 for critical reading, 510 for mathematics, and 490 for writing—are quite close to the mean scores. Why, then, would you ever need to consider a median? In some sets of results, you might find some extreme scores that could affect the mean. For example, if you asked employees at a small business to report their current annual salaries, you might get the following results: $40,000, $45,000, $47,000, $52,000, and $350,000 (we’re assuming this is the boss). The mean in this example would be $106,800, but that figure doesn’t provide a good summary of these numbers. The median, $47,000 in this case, is more representative of your overall results.

</span> refers to the score that occurs most frequently, and it is easy to determine by looking at a histogram. We do not have exact numbers for modal scores on the SAT example,<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_55" data-page="55"></a> but the most frequent range of scores is between 400 and 490 for all three tests (critical reading, mathematics, and writing). The usefulness of the mode depends on the research question that you are asking. In the case of the SAT, the mode provides little interesting information, so let’s return to our drinking data mentioned earlier in the chapter. It might surprise you to learn that although the modal pattern of drinking among U.S. adults overall is “current regular,” among Asian adults living in the United States, the modal pattern is “lifetime abstainer” (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015).</p> <p id="CVVCYCFTY1N5T59NR479" id-sequence="644">The mode is also an advantage over a mean or median when there is more than one mode in a set of data.

</span>, which tells us how tightly clustered around the mean a group of scores is. A smaller standard deviation suggests that most scores might be found near the mean, whereas a larger standard deviation means that the scores are spread out from the mean. Returning to our salary example, we had five salaries with a mean of $106,800. To obtain the standard deviation, which is easy to do with a calculator, you subtract each salary from 106,800, square each difference (to eliminate minus signs), add the squares, find the mean of those differences by dividing the total by five (the number of salaries), and take the square root of the result. In this case, we end up with a standard deviation of 136,021, which means that the average difference between a salary and the mean of the salaries is 136,021. If we discard the extreme salary ($350,000) and find the standard deviation of the remaining four salaries, it turns out to be smaller: 4,966.56. These results suggest that the distribution of the first four salaries is tightly clustered, whereas the distribution of all five salaries is more spread out.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_56" data-page="56"></a> </div> <div class="pageSection" id="YYLCWNFZKV48R578M680" id-sequence="655"> <h3 id="BQSW3M56CW5E2F9QJ850" id-sequence="656"><span class="headingText">The Normal Curve</span></h3> <p id="SYKC1XM4GZQQ49D3F546" id-sequence="657">Many measures of interest to psychologists, such as scores on intelligence tests, which are discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>, appear to form a <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e46" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e46"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e46" id="NYXMMJ57A8Q78RC93500" id-sequence="658"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">normal distribution</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="AUCME3XKL6VEZ1QSW780" id-sequence="659">normal distribution</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A symmetrical probability function</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e46">

The study of ESP is part of the larger field of <em>parapsychology</em>, or the study of psychic phenomena lying outside the typical boundaries of the field of psychology described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-element-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785">Chapter 1</a>. Among the abilities grouped into the category of ESP are <em>telepathy</em> (the ability to communicate with other minds without using the usual methods of speaking or writing), <em>clairvoyance</em> (the ability to perceive objects that do not affect the known senses), <em>precognition</em> (knowledge of future events), and <em>premonition</em> (emotional anticipation of future events). In 2005, Gallup pollsters found that 41% of Americans said that they believed in ESP, with 25% not sure and 32% not believing (Gallup Poll News Service, 2005). Of the scientists who are members of the National Academy of Sciences, 96% said that they did not believe in ESP (<span class="citation" id="JMGYKMLRC9MHHATW8580" id-sequence="675">McConnell &amp; Clark, 1991</span>).</p> <p id="YZLF24E9GK3P2NDAJ670" id-sequence="676">A study of ESP (<span class="citation" id="KQTF5PZ3QVEBHK4N7114" id-sequence="677">Bem, 2011</span>) generated considerable discussion in the scientific community about everything from the statistics that we use to the effects of investigator bias.

The sequencing of the erotic and nonerotic pictures and the left–right positions was determined by a random number generator after the participant made a selection.

Correlation coefficients can range from −1.00 to +1.00. A correlation of −1.00 and a correlation of +1.00 are equally strong but differ in the direction of the effect. A zero correlation indicates that the two variables have no systematic relationship. The closer a correlation coefficient is to −1.00 or to +1.00, the stronger is the relationship between the two variables. When the score is −1.00 or +1.00, the correlation is perfect—all data points follow the pattern. A value between 0 and 1.00 or 0 and −1.00 indicates a correlation direction, but the relationship is not perfect—not every data point conforms to the pattern.</p> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="701"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="704"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="705" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="706" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="JRQTBE9JK91Z69T25452" id-sequence="707"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">2-3c</span> <span class="headingText">Inferential Statistics</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="AFJQ8RLZ2CSHTNF8E132_content" id-sequence="708"> <p id="EAQRVLJH41Q0UYWFQ588" id-sequence="709">Although we can learn a great deal from descriptive statistics, most research described in this textbook features the use of <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e47" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e47"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e47" id="QUMKBWTYXDL3BDNWY012" id-sequence="710"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">inferential statistics</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="LSCTD0216GHSFS8HT306" id-sequence="711">inferential statistics</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Statistical methods that allow experimenters to extend conclusions from samples to larger populations</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf0e47">

Psychology over the years has been justifiably criticized as being the “psychology of the college sophomore.” This criticism arises because researchers are usually college professors, and the students in their courses are a convenient source of willing study participants, especially when extra credit is available. Today’s psychological scientists recognize that college students do not comprise a representative sample of people, and they go to great lengths to recruit samples of participants that are more diverse in age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and other demographic variables. Having a diverse sample supports more generalization than using a sample of college students.</p> <p id="HFQGF5JD86MNQ1QGC308" id-sequence="715">To illustrate the use of inferential statistics, let’s consider the 2009 SAT mathematics test. Men scored an average of 534 and women scored an average of 499 on this test. Does this mean that men perform better than women on this test? Or do men and women perform similarly, and this group is just an unusual sample of test takers?

</span>. We can assess the likelihood of observing a result due to chance by repeating a study, like throwing dice multiple times. We could give the mathematics portion of the SAT to 100 randomly selected samples of male and female college-bound students. If men and women score about the same or women score higher than men in 5 or more of these 100 samples, we would reject our “Men score higher than women” hypothesis as false.</p> <p id="ZSELJZC8G80T1LZ9M021" id-sequence="721">This type of careful analysis of the SAT data has confirmed that the differences on the mathematics portion of the test between male and female test takers are statistically significant (Halpern, et al., 2007; see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="JRGXD1JWSBTSKBJZ3433" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="AFJQ8RLZ2CSHTNF8E132" data-element-id="JRGXD1JWSBTSKBJZ3433">Figure 2.19</a>). Does this result mean that we should consider this difference when deciding on a major or career? Probably not. Keep in mind that the goal of the SAT is to predict college grades. When the math SAT scores of men and women receiving the same letter grade in a mathematics course at the same university were compared, the women scored 33 points less than the men (<span class="citation" id="GLQML9K17ES3Z3UHZ170" id-sequence="722">Wainer &amp; Steinberg, 1992</span>). This is about the same difference that we observed between the mean scores of men and women on the SAT math test. It appears that for some unknown reason, the SAT might be underestimating women’s ability to achieve in college mathematics courses.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1430 rs_skip" id="JRGXD1JWSBTSKBJZ3433" clrenderdata="[&quot;QVMW3SMHWKPEHL7G7084&quot;]" id-sequence="723"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_02_f18-t3.png" data-width="769" data-height="380"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_f18-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="288" data-alt="A line graph shows male and female mean math SAT scores from 1967 to 2005.

Testing and rejecting a null hypothesis tend to encourage us to view variables, like exposure to violent video games, as producing discrete either/or outcomes (aggression or no aggression) when that is unlikely to be the case in reality. An alternative approach is the use of estimation, which includes a report of the 95% confidence interval in addition to the mean (Cumming, 2012; see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MEVWYHC97CH4CFDBP987" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="AFJQ8RLZ2CSHTNF8E132" data-element-id="MEVWYHC97CH4CFDBP987">Figure 2.20</a>). Applying estimation to the video game question might look like this. You could report that the average score on a measure of aggression was 37 ± 2 following exposure to a violent game and 32 ± 2 following exposure to a nonviolent game. This means that 95% of participants are likely to score between 35 and 39 following exposure to an aggressive game, while 95% of participants are likely to score between 30 and 34 following exposure to a nonviolent game. The additional information provided by the confidence interval helps us evaluate the magnitude of the difference better than a simple reporting of the statistical significance of the difference.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1431 rs_skip" id="MEVWYHC97CH4CFDBP987" clrenderdata="[&quot;WEKP5FRM8HNB5H18N023&quot;]" id-sequence="727"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_f19-t2.png" data-width="253" data-height="272" data-alt="An error chart shows the extent to which food additives lead to hyperactivity in children.

Separate guidelines have been developed for each type of subject. Researchers working in universities and other agencies receiving federal funding seek the approval of institutional review boards (IRBs) for human participant research and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) for animal research before conducting their studies. The IRBs and IACUCs are guided by federal regulations and research ethics endorsed by professional societies such as the American Psychological Association (APA), the Association for Psychological Science (APS), and the Society for Neuroscience (SfN). IRBs and IACUCs must include at least one member of the community outside the university or agency, avoiding the possibility that inappropriate research might be conducted in secret. These procedures do not apply to institutions that do not have federal funding, such as private genetics research corporations or consumer product corporations (cosmetics, etc.), although efforts are being made to bring these organizations into compliance with federal standards.</p> <p id="FFYJCR2S5D051SAVK348" id-sequence="742">As you review the ethical guidelines for both human and animal research participants, keep in mind that the guidelines look simpler when you read about their provisions than when you try to implement them in the context of real research.

Developmental psychologists have an obvious interest in children, but a person cannot sign a legal informed consent form until age 18. Can you obtain informed consent from a patient with schizophrenia, who suffers from hallucinations and irrational, delusional beliefs, or from a person in the later stages of Alzheimer’s disease, whose memory and reasoning have deteriorated because of the condition? In these cases, legal permission must be obtained from a qualified guardian. The university IRBs play an essential role in evaluating these ethical dilemmas case by case.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_62" data-page="62"></a> <p id="HXDW0D1CEU78Y31GY064" id-sequence="758">Research also should be conducted in a manner that does no irreversible harm to participants. In some cases, to avoid participants’ desire to appear normal and their tendency to try to outguess the research, researchers might say that they are investigating one factor when they are interested in another. Most cases of deception are quite mild, such as when participants are told that a study is about memory when it is actually a study of some social behavior. When researchers must deceive their participants, extra care must be taken to debrief participants and answer all their questions following the experiment.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1434 rs_skip" id="HGRECM2YBG7SKE9Y3899" clrenderdata="[&quot;WNZAJYEF78LL64XVF598&quot;]" id-sequence="759"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_02_unf34-t2.jpg" data-width="258" data-height="274" data-alt="While examining the papers of Dr. John Cutler, who led the Tuskegee syphilis study, Wellesley College historian Susan Reverby discovered that during the 1940s, U.S. and Guatemalan health officials had deliberately exposed prisoners, soldiers, and mental patients to syphilis and gonorrhea to test the effectiveness of penicillin."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="GYWD6NKK7QYMAG1NX852" id-sequence="760"><p>While examining the papers of Dr. John Cutler, who led the Tuskegee syphilis study, Wellesley College historian Susan Reverby discovered that during the 1940s, U.S. and Guatemalan health officials had deliberately exposed prisoners, soldiers, and mental patients to syphilis and gonorrhea to test the effectiveness of penicillin.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:258px;height:274px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_02_unf34-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="While examining the papers of Dr. John Cutler, who led the Tuskegee syphilis study, Wellesley College historian Susan Reverby discovered that during the 1940s, U.S. and Guatemalan health officials had deliberately exposed prisoners, soldiers, and mental patients to syphilis and gonorrhea to test the effectiveness of penicillin." width="258" height="274" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Wellesley College/MCT/Newscom </div> </div></div></div> <p id="BELT6JLKYUUP7PZPT155" id-sequence="761">Research using human participants should be rigorously private and confidential. <em>Privacy</em> refers to the participants’ control over the sharing of their personal information with others, and methods for ensuring privacy are usually stated in the informed consent paperwork. For example, some studies involve the use of medical records, which participants agree to share with the researchers for the purpose of the experiment. <em>Confidentiality</em> refers to the participants’ right to have their data revealed to others only with their permission. Confidentiality is usually maintained by such practices as substituting codes for names and storing data in locked cabinets.

One of the most egregious examples of unethical research was the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, which lasted from 1932 until 1972. Researchers from the U.S. Public Health Service recruited about 400 impoverished African-American men who had contracted syphilis to study the progression of the disease. None of the men were told they had syphilis, and none were treated, even after penicillin became the standard treatment for the disease in 1947. Many current federal regulations related to research ethics were developed in response to this experiment.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="763"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="766"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="767" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="768" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="WRESDHQNL003X92VT424" id-sequence="769"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">2-4b</span> <span class="headingText">Animal Subjects</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="HKTMB559S7TR5M6L6173_content" id-sequence="770"> <p id="PPTPUMMBZ1GD8Q7HT517" id-sequence="771">The topic of using animals in research is guaranteed to stimulate lively, and possibly heated, discussion. Some people are adamantly opposed to any animal research, whereas others accept the concept of using animals, so long as certain conditions are met. About 7% to 8% of published research in psychology journals involves the use of animals as subjects (American Psychological Association [APA], 2012). A total of 90% of the animals used are rodents and birds, with 5% or fewer studies involving monkeys and other primates.

In addition to serving a clear purpose, animal research requires excellent housing, food, and veterinary care. The most controversial ethical standards relate to minimizing the pain and suffering experienced by animal research subjects. Federal regulations provide guidelines for the use of pain, surgery, stress, and deprivation with animal subjects, as well as the termination of an animal’s life. The standards approximate the community standards that we would expect from local humane societies tasked with euthanizing animals that are not adopted.</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_63" data-page="63"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_psychologytakesonrealworldproblems narrative  rs_skip" id="WNKREHU4K47H3JS00555" label="psychologytakesonrealworldproblems" id-sequence="775"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Psychology Takes on Real-World Problems</span><h3 id="VSWBKL4K9CKZWG96X553" id-sequence="776">Choosing a Research Method for Studying Cyberbullying</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="WNKREHU4K47H3JS00555_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="777"> <p id="RMEGK9DA4YK5A8RAD942" id-sequence="778">In <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-element-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785">Chapter 1</a>, we suggested using the problem of cyberbullying as our “real-world problem.” In this chapter, we’ll try to examine the different ways that we could approach this question using our best research methods and ethics.</p> <p id="KSGX7YZX1XNTA077V052" id-sequence="779">Bullying is not new, but cyberbullying is. To study a relatively new phenomenon, we might begin with descriptive methods. In addition, correlational methods might help us identify factors that predispose individuals to bullying or being bullied, as well as likely outcomes of cyberbullying (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="WKEK38D9NUA7TN64C177" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-section-id="HKTMB559S7TR5M6L6173" data-element-id="WKEK38D9NUA7TN64C177">Figure 2.21</a>).

First, most cyberbullying research focuses on schoolchildren and young adults. Using minors as research participants requires additional steps, such as obtaining both parental consent and the assent of the participant. We do not want your parents to have the ability to sign you up for research against your will. Second, a participant who has been a cyberbullying victim might react negatively to reminders of the experience. We would need to make this risk very clear in the informed consent materials and take special care to remind participants they can quit the study at any time. The informed consent form should include referrals to counseling services available to participants in the event that they feel a need to discuss their experiences.</p> </div></div> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_64" data-page="64"></a> <div class="container dependent mt_interpersonalrelationships narrative  rs_skip" id="SXSPRYZWCFY86D2CZ038" label="interpersonalrelationships" id-sequence="788"><div class="containerHeading"><span class="label"> Interpersonal Relationships</span><h3 id="BBFV2KX9NFVCZV22F574" id-sequence="789">The Methodological Perspective</h3></div><div class="sidebarContent" id="SXSPRYZWCFY86D2CZ038_sidebarcontent" id-sequence="790"> <div class="pageSection" id="AYBSV0PSJUS28A8P8149" id-sequence="791"> <h3 id="GDZD2NGFF7GDFU88L053" id-sequence="792"><span class="headingText">Can We Differentiate “Like” from “Love”?</span></h3> <p id="PLBT443HJ5SV3CT4M086" id-sequence="793">The end of <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-chapter-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785" data-element-id="RGLWV0E24Q79YQJK9785">chapter 1</a> noted that each chapter would feature a discussion of how the chapter’s material could be used to talk about relationships.

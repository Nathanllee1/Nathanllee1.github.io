But as we all know from personal experience, the social world can be challenging; consider, if you can, some truly embarrassing memories about social mistakes that you’ve made. Our need to understand our complex social environment was one of the driving forces that shaped the development of our large human brains (<span class="citation" id="WXYERD9CLJ185LPYS944" id-sequence="30">Cacioppo &amp; Decety, 2011</span>).</p> <p id="QYJPR4FS974DD9QVH631" id-sequence="31">Among the social environments with the largest minefields is the connections that we make with others in intimate, romantic relationships. The two people in the photograph <strong>at left</strong> appear to find each other attractive, and they are engaged in behaviors—both variable and choreographed—designed to further their relationship. Looking at the developing relationship, psychologists can see a number of processes at work, such as first impressions and the effects of perceived similarities that are discussed in detail in this chapter.</p> <p id="NWKZS9BFGYVRUU97H653" id-sequence="32">Zooming in, however, we see a different set of processes at work. Although most of us believe that we choose romantic partners on the basis of perceived attractiveness and compatibility, there is some “chemistry” at work here too. Overall, humans share more genes in common with spouses (<span class="citation" id="SLKJSPJTRWH6HMQMC893" id-sequence="33">Domingue, Fletcher, Conley, &amp; Boardman, 2014</span>) and friends (<span class="citation" id="KBDUCK5JJ2J1UBTRU487" id-sequence="34">Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2014</span>) than they do with strangers. In some cases, however, being genetically different from your partner is desirable. The highlighted genes in the larger image help determine a person’s immune system response. Furthermore, variations of these genes, or alleles, are associated with different detectable body odors (Wedekind &amp; Füri, 1997). As attractive and compatible as these individuals seem to each other, one might reject the other in response to this odor. Our evolutionary history has left us with the ability to detect a genetic compatibility in a partner, as well as more surface compatibilities.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_2" data-page="2"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1709 rs_skip" id="HTVUPM7SNDFQJEJXP446" clrenderdata="[&quot;WHXPU4MVGEYVAME6T774&quot;]" id-sequence="35"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf01-t2.jpg" data-width="293" data-height="252" data-alt="Learning Objectives"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:293px;height:252px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_13_unf01-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Learning Objectives" width="293" height="252" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Maridav/ <a target="_blank" id="NUADT4TATGWFSEF9Y641" name="NUADT4TATGWFSEF9Y641" class="external" href="http://Shutterstock.com" id-sequence="36">Shutterstock.com</a></div> </div></div></div> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf170a rs_skip" id="MDQP18CKDR81DDK8Q986" clrenderdata="[&quot;JYZB9BB3S7ETMJ0PP960&quot;]" id-sequence="37"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="547" data-height="336" data-alt="Individual humans are not that impressive, but cooperating in groups makes our species more capable."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="YWKVNRQGNFDLHCUKP004" id-sequence="38"><p>Individual humans are not that impressive, but cooperating in groups makes our species more capable.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:547px;height:336px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_13_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Individual humans are not that impressive, but cooperating in groups makes our species more capable." width="547" height="336" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Hans Deryk/Reuters </div> </div></div></div> <p id="VSJETQS6QJH1324NL759" id-sequence="39">Zooming out from our couple, we see that their romance takes place within a larger social context.

Perceived isolation,<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_3" data-page="3"></a> or loneliness, can initiate a cascade of negative interactions that further separate individuals from the social contact they need and want, interfere with the quality of sleep, increase feelings of negative mood and hostility, and lead to a heightened sensitivity to threat and attack (<span class="citation" id="LHTVHHZ3J3P5FXTAP945" id-sequence="60">Cacioppo et al., 2015</span>). <span class="citation" id="DFRE189GA5379SLZ0776" id-sequence="61"> Cacioppo, Hawkley, &amp; Thisted, 2010</span>). The isolated person begins to behave in ways that are self-protective but that paradoxically push people away and promote further rejection and isolation. As a result, we are highly motivated to stay in the good graces of our social groups.

nonasterisked items. Then add up all the asterisked items and subtract this total from 45. You will notice that these items are “reversals,” in which the “nonlonely” answers are the higher numbers. Questionnaires use this strategy to keep someone from just picking the same number all the way through an instrument. Add the two sums together to find your total score, which can range from 20 to 80.</p> <p id="JXXNBCALP7AT3UN9A152" id-sequence="508"><strong><em>Interpreting your score:</em></strong> Obviously, there are no right or wrong answers on an instrument like this, but higher numbers indicate higher levels of subjective loneliness. For comparison’s sake, <span class="citation" id="NKLXQHXBB1MFZ9FDY254" id-sequence="509"> Russell (1996)</span> administered this instrument to college students, nurses, and the elderly. The nurses had the highest scores (mean = 40.14), followed by college students (40.08) and older adults (31.51). It might surprise you that the college students felt more loneliness than the older adults! This is probably because loneliness results from one’s <em>perceived</em> disconnection, not absolute number of relationships. It is possible that college students have higher expectations for connectivity or that the elderly have had more time to establish meaningful relationships with others.</p> <p id="RYTMSK82KM73A01E6999" id-sequence="510">If your score seems on the high side, don’t despair. Not only do psychological scientists understand quite a bit about loneliness, but they also have some empirically supported suggestions for alleviating it. One key to reducing feelings of loneliness is to understand how lonely people behave. Loneliness is associated with a number of maladaptive social cognitions, including increased sensitivity to social threats, better memory for negative social information, more negative social expectations, and behavior that confirms negative expectations. In other words, lonely people act in counterproductive ways that further drive them away from the social connectivity they seek (<span class="citation" id="JZZG6U2V150WW8B14580" id-sequence="511">Cacioppo &amp; Hawkley, 2009</span>; <span class="citation" id="FEJT41WKE97YH3GW4026" id-sequence="512"> Cacioppo, Norris, Decety, Monteleone, &amp; Nusbaum, 2009</span>).

In particular, people are likely to use faces to form impressions. Halo effects occur when one characteristic or a small number of characteristics have a large impact on overall perception. If people see characteristics that they value or dislike, they tend to make simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments. One person might be attracted to blue eyes, and another might be turned off by tattoos. In one study, students hearing a professor described as “warm” instead of “cold” were willing to say after a brief encounter that he was a more effective teacher, less ruthless, and more humorous (<span class="citation" id="GVVUQQ196U5KSF08M707" id-sequence="514">Widmeyer &amp; Loy, 1988</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf170c rs_skip" id="ASEYDVVVEX6YZB7R9776" clrenderdata="[&quot;QWBKVRDU6362XN6S0858&quot;]" id-sequence="515"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf03-t2.jpg" data-width="576" data-height="321" data-alt="Speed dating, in which people have a limited time to decide whether they would like further contact with another person, takes advantage of the rapid assessments of one another that we make.

Once we have reached a conclusion about a person, even after a brief social exchange in a speed-dating experiment, we tend to stick with that assessment for a long time. Most of us have formed a false first impression of others (either overly positive or overly negative) that breaks down only after extensive further exposure, if at all. However, in the face of certain types of new information, first impressions do change (<span class="citation" id="RCMW89WDWHNF6Y7SG926" id-sequence="518">Brannon &amp; Gawronski, 2016</span>; <span class="citation" id="WGXJM61SZPSYPPHQ6086" id-sequence="519"> Mann &amp; Ferguson, 2017</span>).

For example, if your friend just flunked an important exam, you could try to answer the question “Why?” by considering your friend’s personal characteristics and circumstances. In considering your friend’s disposition, you might recall that she is anxious (being anxious is dispositional), which might have interfered with her performance on a stressful test. In considering your friend’s situation, you remember that she just broke up with her romantic partner of several years (breaking up is situational), which was depressing and distracting for her as she prepared for her test.</p> <p id="MENSC21JB3AFCZP4W803" id-sequence="552">Thinking that disposition and situation act in an either/or fashion instead of interacting to produce an outcome is no more helpful to our understanding of behavior than using either/or thinking in considering nature and nurture (<span class="citation" id="WWXFYZF7WUNCJGFK5741" id-sequence="553">Funder, 2009</span>; <span class="citation" id="ZGTMGTYLY3Q4SACWV440" id-sequence="554"> Johnson, 2009</span>). However, as will be shown in the next section, the weight placed on dispositional and situational variables as explanations for behavior can vary dramatically from one case to the next. Although our attributions typically guide us in the right direction, we do make errors. We are not able to read minds, so we must make a logical leap from what we observe in a person’s behavior to the internal state of mind that produced it. However, sometimes that leap takes us in the wrong direction.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="555"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="558"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="559" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="560" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="MKKX1UFBW2S2KQGA9199" id-sequence="561"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-3a</span> <span class="headingText">The Correspondence Bias and the Fundamental Attribution Error</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="ECZWW4DKMT0X9D5X0343_content" id-sequence="562"> <p id="VKPWVMTRA9DQBDPVE687" id-sequence="563">When you hear about people flunking a test, you are likely to start making conclusions about their dispositions (“she is a lazy student” or “he is not very smart”), even though you are quite aware that the professor giving the test has a reputation for writing brutal exams.

In other words, we usually expect people’s behavior to correspond to their dispositions, even when we know for sure that the situation is having a powerful effect.</p> <p id="FJJPRVLRQA66W6Z03470" id-sequence="568">Given the importance of making accurate attributions to our survival and social relationships, why would such a bias ever occur? Psychologists are still debating the reasons for this error. One possibility might be the genuine stability of personality traits (discussed in<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_8" data-page="8"></a> <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-element-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196">Chapter 12</a>). Although traits interact with situations to produce behavior, people often believe that the “You did it because that is the kind of person you are” explanation is accurate. There is some truth to these beliefs, which is why they persist. But at the same time, our discussion of personality has shown that situations make important contributions to behavior. You might consider yourself to be a helpful person, but you might ignore someone with a flat tire when you’re late for class or work.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf170e rs_skip" id="KCCJP02GFXMLY9RW0692" clrenderdata="[&quot;TDCKV10EVVRMVB9WV432&quot;]" id-sequence="569"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf04-t2.jpg" data-width="390" data-height="268" data-alt="Are the famous Wal-Mart greeters really friendly people?

In many everyday instances, we simply do not have enough information about somebody’s circumstances to consider situational variables in our attributions. A grumpy, unenthusiastic professor might be having health or personal problems of which students in the classroom are unaware, but by default, the students believe that the professor is characteristically grumpy and unenthusiastic. In other cases, we seem to misjudge the likelihood that typical people will respond to a situation in a certain way. Later in this chapter, you will learn how a majority of individuals were willing to electrocute another participant simply because they were told to do so by an experimenter. You might think, “I would never respond to the situation like that,” which might lead to your misjudging the power of the situation.</p> <p id="SLNC9J2V0P9TP624L664" id-sequence="573">A concept closely related to the correspondence bias is known as the <strong>fundamental attribution error</strong> (<em>FAE</em>; Ross, 1977). According to this view, people do not underestimate situational variables as proposed by correspondence bias, but instead completely fail to consider situational variables while making attributions. By default, this total neglect of situational influences leads to a reliance on dispositional contributions to explain the resulting observed behavior. Research evidence for such a consistent neglect of observed situational variables is lacking (<span class="citation" id="NHJY3RE1K6K3WV9QC676" id-sequence="574">Gawronski, 2004</span>). For example, in the study mentioned earlier about administering shock, how do you think people view the minority of participants who did not comply? If we globally ignore situational variables, as required by the FAE, we should attribute the behavior of these individuals to their strong moral character (disposition), but this is not what usually happens (<span class="citation" id="CAHQN5F81A0Q8BE9Q488" id-sequence="575">Gilbert &amp; Malone, 1995</span>). Instead, most people attribute the minority’s behavior to simply responding to the situation “the way people ought to do.” The situation still plays a significant role in people’s interpretation of the observed behavior, which is inconsistent with the premises of the FAE. This leaves the correspondence bias as the superior explanation for how people balance their assessments of disposition and situation.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="576"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="579"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="580" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="581" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="CNJDDDE6ALKSKXXL1572" id-sequence="582"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-3b</span> <span class="headingText">Defensive Attributions</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="PJZY4MP4AFQAKW8MY324_content" id-sequence="583"> <p id="YJAZ4812ETCK6HW8G650" id-sequence="584">The correspondence bias is not the only flaw in our judgment of behavior.

When we succeed, we are more likely to attribute our success to dispositional variables. For example, if you get an A in this course, you are likely to congratulate yourself for your brains and<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_9" data-page="9"></a> hard work. In contrast, if you fail the course, it is because of situational factors, such as the professor’s asking unfair questions on the final exam. The self-serving bias can make you feel better, but it also can make it harder to learn from experience. Elite athletes, for example, are less likely than less successful athletes to use situational variables to excuse poor performance, such as blaming the weather when they lose a game (<span class="citation" id="HGJGUS93XB3Y1ZM6A777" id-sequence="595">Roesch &amp; Amirkhan, 1997</span>).

None of the measures were self-report because the researchers expressed concerns that the students would feel the need to answer in socially appropriate ways. For example, the cultural thought task asks the participants to decide which two items out of a group of three “go together.” If we asked you to do this for “train, bus, tracks,” what would you choose? People from individualistic cultures tend to make abstract pairings, such as train and bus, which belong to the same category. People from collectivistic cultures tend to make more holistic pairings, such as train and tracks, because they share a functional relationship. The responses of the students were analyzed in terms of their location in the wheat-growing north of China or the rice-growing south. Raising rice requires high levels of cooperation (a married couple cannot grow the rice needed to support a family by themselves), but growing wheat requires less, so the authors expected more collectivist responses from southern students than from northern students. The authors quoted a 17th-century Chinese farming guide that says, “If one is short of labor, it is best to grow wheat.”</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1710 rs_skip" id="UNAZLAVJENB1VXXZ9388" clrenderdata="[&quot;PVEBSNE8WLVACDEXN134&quot;]" id-sequence="605"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_f03-t2.png" data-width="413" data-height="331" data-alt="A bubble graph shows the score of Han Chinese on holistic thinking and divorce rates.

Attitudes can influence behavior, which is why the advertising industry spends billions of dollars each year in an attempt to shape your attitudes toward various products.</p> <p id="GVRMSME1T0AARPERW739" id-sequence="662">Because we depend on our attitudes to guide our behavior, we want to make sure that they are “correct” (<span class="citation" id="RNZXX8KGMV702Q1LR958" id-sequence="663">Festinger, 1950</span>). Imagine what would happen if you woke up one day to discover that your attitudes about people, objects, and issues were all wrong. Suddenly your closest<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_12" data-page="12"></a> friends would dislike you, your major would be a poor match for your interests and abilities, and your entire collection of music would sound dreadful. Occasional mistakes happen, but holding accurate attitudes makes it easier for us to maneuver through environments successfully.</p> <p id="PDXPV0TWKD6PSAABU536" id-sequence="664">Attitudes share three basic elements: affect (i.e., emotion), behavior, and cognition (the ABCs). For example, how might your attitudes about your college major be affected by hearing a negative news report about the job market for new college graduates in that field? The affective aspect of an attitude addresses emotional responses to the object. This information about your future job prospects could make you feel quite helpless, frightened, or angry. Behavior reflects the way that people respond to the object. After hearing the news, you might schedule an appointment with your adviser to discuss ways that you can pursue the subjects you love and still have a great career. The cognitive aspect of an attitude includes beliefs about the object. In response to this news, you might believe that you have chosen the wrong major.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1713 rs_skip" id="RTDS5GBCVYKC70YNS778" clrenderdata="[&quot;GQWQGK90GE8U1GGTK469&quot;]" id-sequence="665"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf07-t2.jpg" data-width="358" data-height="240" data-alt="If you have any doubt whether people are emotional about their attitudes, just ask some friends whether they prefer an Apple (represented by the late Steve Jobs, left) or a PC (represented by Bill Gates, right).

As a result, many people prefer to stay on the “winning side” by forming attitudes based on how frequently they hear an opinion expressed by others and in the media (Noelle-Neumann, 1984).

Operant conditioning suggests that approval or disapproval shapes a person’s attitudes. An opinion expressed in class that is followed by nods and claps will be repeated in the future more than one that is met with horror and disgust. Because of classical conditioning, you are likely to form positive attitudes toward stimuli associated with positive outcomes. If a song is popular at a happy time of your life, it is likely that your subsequent attitude toward the song will be positive too. Observational learning also can be a powerful mechanism for learning attitudes. Children who are exposed to particular attitudes in their homes, communities, and media duplicate them, especially if they observe the person expressing the attitude being rewarded.</p> <p id="JVZY6DWMM2MAQUETX145" id-sequence="678">Can attitudes be influenced by genetics?

</span> provides a powerful tool for producing attitude change (<span class="citation" id="UQCN14B9RF2Z0UUMQ438" id-sequence="699">Festinger, 1957</span>). Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable state that occurs when our outward behavior doesn’t match our attitudes. For example, you might have been accepted by several colleges and universities, but you can choose to attend only one. Thinking about the positive features of the schools you reject causes dissonance (I like these schools, but I didn’t choose them), which could be resolved either by becoming a “superfan” of your chosen school or by forming negative attitudes toward the schools that you reject. How could you even consider making another choice? Who would want to go to those other schools?</p> <p id="PXQZP0UM73BTVH3JU118" id-sequence="700">For attitude change to occur as result of cognitive dissonance, we must attribute our actions to our own voluntary, free will. In an early demonstration of cognitive dissonance (<span class="citation" id="LBPFQQUW5KZDHYLXC184" id-sequence="701">Festinger &amp; Carlsmith, 1959</span>), students completed two boring tasks (putting empty spools on a tray, emptying the tray, then filling it again; turning square pegs one quarter-turn at a time). Afterward, they were asked to tell another person that the tasks were fun. This should produce some level of cognitive dissonance (I publicly said the tasks were fun, but I really think they’re boring). The researchers offered to pay $1 (about $8.35 in 2017 dollars) or $20 (about $167.08 in 2017 dollars) to participants for saying that the tasks were fun. In contrast to students who were neither paid nor asked to say that the tasks were fun (the control group), the students paid $1 rated the tasks as much more fun. Interestingly, rating of the tasks’ enjoyability by the students paid $20, who could easily have justified that behavior (I’m being paid well to do this), did not differ from the controls.</p> <p id="QULY8PBP1H9AX4D6N767" id-sequence="702">Brain imaging studies provide substantial support for cognitive dissonance (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="YASE2FVA9T5M1GVVD068" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="NZWGA5K2ZFVUGFKNE422" data-element-id="YASE2FVA9T5M1GVVD068">Figure 13.5</a>). Many people undergoing functional magnetic brain imaging (fMRI) find being confined in the scanner tube and the loud banging of the magnets to be unpleasant. Still, in one study, participants undergoing fMRI were asked to describe the somewhat unpleasant scanner experience as pleasant (van Veen, Krug, Schooler, &amp; Carter, 2009). Levels of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula were higher when a participant made dissonant statements about how pleasant the fMRI experience was compared to neutral statements. Subsequent research has confirmed that the ACC is often engaged during episodes of cognitive conflict, while activity in areas of the insula corresponds to negative arousal (<span class="citation" id="ECGP0A7JZWKRWZWR9200" id-sequence="703">Kitayama, Chua, Tompson, &amp; Han, 2013</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1715 rs_skip" id="YASE2FVA9T5M1GVVD068" clrenderdata="[&quot;SQAVNZNX0WUZNAPVG529&quot;]" id-sequence="704"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_f05-t2.png" data-width="580" data-height="512" data-alt="Line graphs are shown in panels ay and b and active areas of the brain are shown in panel c.

To resolve this inconsistency, one of these ideas needs to change.

</span> organizes and predicts our responses to persuasive messages by recognizing two major pathways leading to changes in attitudes (<span class="citation" id="ZVAXLR6689F9U9Y5R020" id-sequence="737">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1981</span>). The first, known as the central route to persuasion, occurs when a person considers persuasive arguments carefully and thoughtfully. The second, known as the peripheral route to persuasion, occurs when a person responds to peripheral cues, as described in the following section, without considering the quality of the argument carefully. Importantly, attitudes achieved through the central route are more enduring, more resistant to<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_15" data-page="15"></a> counterpersuasion, and more predictive of behavior than are attitudes achieved through the peripheral route (<span class="citation" id="EQQQNLJMT9TMHGV8R789" id-sequence="738">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986b</span>).</p> <p id="NKYF6RXSHY8PV3AEF207" id-sequence="739">Why do we need two systems for responding to persuasive messages? Ideally, we would use the central route to consider all messages that we encounter. However, given our limited time, knowledge, and cognitive resources, a thorough evaluation of all the messages that we perceive is not practical. Using the peripheral route allows us to use heuristics, or rules of thumb (as described in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>), to react promptly to many situations. If you feel overwhelmed by the large number of candidates on your ballot, you might use the heuristic of voting along party lines or voting like your friends.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1717 rs_skip" id="GKZP1PN0AR2EBX3CD316" clrenderdata="[&quot;AXYAUZ4JYHTTVQJ48198&quot;]" id-sequence="740"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf10-t2.jpg" data-width="453" data-height="274" data-alt="Experts attending a technology trade show are likely to use the central route to persuasion while evaluating the speaker’s message.

According to the ELM, a person’s motivation influences which route is used to evaluate a particular argument. When students are highly motivated to take time out of their busy schedules to attend a presentation by a guest speaker on campus because they know and care about the topic of the lecture, they are likely to use the central route and evaluate the speaker’s points carefully.</p> <p id="UGBZ8GR6ND5G2ZVTB001" id-sequence="751">People are also likely to use the central route to persuasion when they are well educated about a topic. However, even people who are knowledgeable occasionally take the peripheral rather than the central route. If you know about a topic but do not have the time to think about it or don’t care about it, you might find the shortcuts provided by the peripheral route more useful. In addition, because using the central route requires so many cognitive resources, including attention, we are less likely to process persuasive messages this way when we are distracted by other information or activities. As you concentrate on driving down a busy highway, you do not have the cognitive resources to evaluate the messages on billboards carefully.</p> <p id="ZFDJ3L79JDY3GW4ZD679" id-sequence="752">If a person is using the peripheral route to persuasion, what cues might influence the amount of attitude change that occurs? Peripheral cues usually apply to the persuasive message (e.g., the number of arguments), the manner in which the message is presented (e.g., speed of speech and accent), or the characteristics of the speaker (e.g., credibility or celebrity).</p> <p id="TUUTHBQV652209GL5435" id-sequence="753">Emotional appeals can influence people using the peripheral route. Both positive and negative emotions can enhance persuasion. Students asked to read persuasive messages about topics such as curing cancer and the state of military forces were more likely to agree with the statement they read while happily snacking on Pepsi and peanuts (<span class="citation" id="QGXFLG6F15T4SVBDX318" id-sequence="754">Dabbs &amp; Janis, 1965</span>). Efforts to persuade using negative emotions are especially common. We hear daily warnings about the dangers of drinking too much, not using our seatbelts, engaging in risky sex practices, riding a bicycle without a helmet, eating trans fats, and so on.</p> <p id="UYZSS7DHTV2C5KP5D685" id-sequence="755">Arousing negative emotions, such as fear, can be risky. If people are too frightened by a message, they go into a state of denial. “It’s really not that bad,” they will say, or “That can’t happen here.” Denial is most likely to occur if the audience is not given an action to do to reduce their anxiety. It is fine to scare smokers to death about the appearance of their lungs, so long as you include a message that tells them where to get help to quit smoking. Having a sense of control over their response will reduce the fear and make the message more persuasive (<span class="citation" id="MZDSTK90J4QFMZH61438" id-sequence="756">Ajzen, 1991</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1718 rs_skip" id="BQKH7A3B02TV03SHA675" clrenderdata="[&quot;CSTEDHST2KKBMK75P707&quot;]" id-sequence="757"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf11-t2.jpg" data-width="380" data-height="245" data-alt="A picture of a bus on a road.

We understand that athletes and other celebrities are being paid large amounts of money to advertise particular products, so we tend to discount their opinions (Moore, Mowen, &amp; Reardon, 1994). A testimonial by someone who has nothing to gain by speaking in favor of a product or issue is more persuasive. As a result of these findings, bloggers must disclose whether they are being compensated for writing about a brand. Without this information, we might not evaluate their arguments correctly.</p> </div></div> <p id="RUMQYZP6BYR6K8SQD365" id-sequence="762">A positive response to the speaker can enhance a message’s persuasion. Despite the common-sense warning that “beauty is only skin deep,” people have a deep-seated stereotype that what is beautiful is good (<span class="citation" id="BSGHWBTJNA9A3L6XD679" id-sequence="763">Dion, Berscheid, &amp; Walster, 1972</span>). Student evaluations of a<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_16" data-page="16"></a> professor are heavily influenced by the perceived attractiveness of the professor (<span class="citation" id="LKHPMBD8BC07W8EQQ213" id-sequence="764">Hamermesh &amp; Parker, 2005</span>). People are more likely to be persuaded by people they like and with whom they share some similarity (<span class="citation" id="QHSB0C2BTF4PUARVR274" id-sequence="765">Cialdini, 2001</span>; <span class="citation" id="RWQUWDS0N9PNQV9HS526" id-sequence="766"> Van Knippenberg &amp; Wilke, 1992</span>). Similarities need not be substantial to produce this effect; study participants who shared a first name or birthday with the supposed author of a persuasive essay were more likely to agree with the essay (<span class="citation" id="BUSQSBS3B71P87UZK163" id-sequence="767">Silvia, 2005</span>).</p> <p id="SCMNT8FJB94UH3J5Z799" id-sequence="768">A credible speaker is usually more persuasive, especially when listeners are traveling the peripheral route. In turn, credibility is based on the speaker’s perceived expertise and trustworthiness. Expertise is often established by a person’s history and credentials. We suspect that your psychology professors would look different to you if they indicated that their degrees were in other subjects and that they really didn’t know much about psychology.</p> <p id="NCHL3A2LPTRKR83PX741" id-sequence="769">Persuasion is also influenced by the medium used to communicate a message, from the face-to-face presentation of the door-to-door salesperson (a rarity these days) to print media, social media, the Internet, and movies and television. Typically, we find that the more a medium resembles a live interaction with another person, the more effective it is in transmitting a persuasive message. In general, face-to-face contact remains more effective than the use of other media (<span class="citation" id="KDLS49T1SSP2L72BH663" id-sequence="770">Bavelas, Hutchinson, Kenwood, &amp; Matheson, 1997</span>). This arrangement is the most natural way for humans to communicate. Not only is face-to-face communication the first medium we learn in childhood, but various technologies allowing communication at a distance developed at much later points in human history.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1719 rs_skip" id="CCCFZHU8SBQZ7UP32521" clrenderdata="[&quot;FCLNBCWVPNA6GR3FD666&quot;]" id-sequence="771"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf12-t2.jpg" data-width="353" data-height="262" data-alt="A picture of a child looking at a carton in a supermarket."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="UHZQSXQ1TJQD5VE96070" id-sequence="772"><p>Children are more likely than adults to respond to persuasive messages emotionally rather than logically, making them more susceptible to persuasion.

Young children are more likely to respond to persuasive arguments emotionally rather than logically, which might make them more susceptible to attitude change (and advertising) than adults.

Digital sources of news currently rank second only to television, and twice as many adults see news online compared to seeing news in print (<span class="citation" id="ZSLK4EKVRY5RL33ZC923" id-sequence="782">Matsa &amp; Lu, 2016</span>). Historically, persuasive messages from traditional news outlets such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television were more of a one-way street. However, in an environment in which everybody with a computer can produce information, receivers of information can be influencers as well by sharing and commenting on messages in blogs and on social networking sites. Research in this area suggests that user-generated content in the form of blogs, uploaded videos, comments, and reviews is considered as credible and accurate<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_17" data-page="17"></a> as formal news reports prepared by professional journalists (<span class="citation" id="NJQG3453QQ4MMGVWQ437" id-sequence="783">Lee, Park, Lee, &amp; Cameron, 2010</span>). In addition, knowing that content is “popular” with other users significantly raises a message’s impact (<span class="citation" id="JNKS7XBP41DQPZ0JH624" id-sequence="784">Steyn, Wallstrom, &amp; Pitt, 2010</span>).</p> <p id="SSFL0TR1SFWML771M239" id-sequence="785">As more people depend on online sources for their information, psychologists and other professionals have expressed concerns about the quality of that information. So-called fake news is not a new concept, but the ability of the Internet to spread it brings a whole new dimension to its ability to persuade large numbers of people. At risk are people’s collective memories, or our shared understanding of “what really happened.” Fake news can occur in both traditional and online sources, but in the online domain, the term usually refers to sensational stories that are used to lure readers to a site to gain ad revenue. Among the most widely spread fake news stories of 2016 included “Obama signs executive order banning the pledge of allegiance in schools nationwide” (with 2,177,000 Facebook shares, comments, and reactions) and “Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for President, releases statement” (with 961,000 Facebook shares, comments, and reactions).</p> <p id="MVRH3FSRXSMZ3PC85652" id-sequence="786">About 16% of Americans have admitted to having shared fake news by mistake (<span class="citation" id="QEHPBHW0HARB23M9R054" id-sequence="787">Barthel, Mitchell, &amp; Holcomb, 2016</span>), and an alarming number seem to think satirical sites like The Onion post real news stories.

Researchers are beginning to explore the underlying brain processes responsible for these changes (<span class="citation" id="SLESLPQR1SRFX1582415" id-sequence="797">Cacioppo, Cacioppo, &amp; Petty, 2017</span>).</p> <p id="GAML28E5LRBVWK3B4398" id-sequence="798">Examinations of neural correlates of source factors (such as expertise and celebrity) and message factors (such as positivity/negativity) identify areas of the prefrontal cortex as playing an important role, but many additional structures and networks also participate. Researchers also have begun to explore the neural basis for the effects of persuasive messages on the intention to behave and on actual changes in behavior. Southern Californians were scanned using fMRI (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-chapter-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839" data-element-id="ZUXJT37ZGC28NP5YG839">Chapter 4</a>) while receiving persuasive messages about using sunscreen (<span class="citation" id="CCDHVLQ36AKYQPWW9896" id-sequence="799">Falk, Berkman, Mann, Harrison, &amp; Lieberman, 2010</span>). The researchers identified areas within the prefrontal cortex that predicted participants’ changes in sunscreen use 1 week after the scan.</p> <p id="FTGEN5UTAJZ2D9381287" id-sequence="800">Significant progress has been made in this area, but the problem is extremely complex. Thinking about and acting on a persuasive appeal, as noted in this chapter, combine a number of cognitive and emotional processes. It would be surprising if the underlying neural correlates were simple rather than complex. Some untapped possibilities for pursuing this research question involve studying the aging brain and manipulating brain activity through the use of magnetic stimulation (<span class="citation" id="CFWWR0S1WQEVD3X9J998" id-sequence="801">Cacioppo et al., 2016</span>). The aging brain would enlighten this discussion because the prefrontal cortex undergoes more dramatic change during aging than many other brain structures. Older adults differ in their susceptibility to deceptive advertising and their willingness to change their attitudes in the face of conflicting information. Assessing the differences between these groups and between younger and older participants could be very useful. Magnetic stimulation, which changes the activity of underlying brain structures, could be used to investigate whether particular structures or networks were crucial for a persuasive outcome.</p> <p id="FNPD5AYKDRKCHAA2V899" id-sequence="802">While it might take some time to fully grasp the neural correlates of persuasion, efforts in this direction will help us better understand both the process of persuasion itself and the general information processing performed by the brain.</p> </div></div> <div class="container dependent mt_summary narrative  rs_skip" id="LKCGK4FXDHDM2X1DF501"

Our concepts are associated with a variety of characteristics, such as “Birds have feathers.” We frequently have exemplars, or best examples, of each category. If you think of the word <em>bird</em>, you are probably more likely to imagine a canary than an ostrich. Finally, we generalize from our known concepts when faced with new information. If we know that birds peck at objects placed before them, we are less likely to stick our fingers near the beak of a new type of bird. In other words, based on our past experience with or knowledge of birds, we are prejudging the behavior of an unfamiliar bird. This process of categorizing information enables us to make rapid decisions about new situations and objects, similar to the rules of thumb, or <em>heuristics</em>, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-chapter-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880" data-element-id="PWZAN7SUG6TWKKB67880">Chapter 10</a>.</p> <p id="LJWJ7TNBDE4RWBQ9A333" id-sequence="871">Effective concepts are inclusive, recognizing a full range of associated characteristics. When our categories are oversimplified, we are left with stereotypes. Although it is true that most birds fly, it is inaccurate to oversimplify the matter by just saying “Birds fly,” because ostriches do not. Stereotypes often contain an element of truth but become inaccurate because of the information that they exclude. More important, stereotypes conflict with our valid desire to be viewed and treated as individuals.</p> <p id="TLQVTJT0RT12B9JYN584" id-sequence="872">If stereotypes can lead us astray, why are they so pervasive and persistent? People tend to misjudge correlations between groups and their stereotypical behaviors. They might overestimate the percentage of Asian students who excel in math and science or underestimate the number of White athletes who play professional basketball. Attributions, discussed earlier, also contribute to continued stereotyping. If you see an exception to your stereotype (perhaps a female who is running faster than her male friend), you might view her success as the result of situational variables. Perhaps the man is letting her win to be nice. This type of thinking allows us to maintain a “women are weaker” stereotype.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf171f rs_skip" id="RPMWYP3X3SJYXN4R1974" clrenderdata="[&quot;DSAQ50201P288AA28545&quot;]" id-sequence="873"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf16-t2.jpg" data-width="234" data-height="331" data-alt="People often have negative stereotypes about overweight people as a group.

Someone might express dramatically prejudiced opinions about a group and yet treat members of that group well. Individuals can be viewed as being different or exceptions, allowing people to retain their stereotypes in the face of conflicting observations. Instead of rethinking a stereotype about truck drivers and country music, you view your truck-driving friend who enjoys opera to be one of a kind. Finally, stereotypes are often maintained by people’s expectations. In one experiment, students listening to a basketball game were informed that a certain player was either “Black” or “White.” After the game, students who believed the athlete was Black expressed their stereotypes by rating the player as being highly athletic, while those who believed that the athlete was White praised him for his intelligence and hustle (<span class="citation" id="KQQSR4GSYPBNSYLN5922" id-sequence="878">Stone, Perry, &amp; Darley, 1997</span>).</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_20" data-page="20"></a> <p id="FPAQ7UTFP45BF0CQ5668" id-sequence="879">Prejudice, like other types of attitudes, can result from direct experience (I had one boring history professor, so all history professors must be bad), or they can be indirectly absorbed from the social world of peers, parents, the community, and the media. Human prejudice based on group membership, however, might have deeper roots in our evolutionary past. Recognizing and reacting to individuals based on group affiliation was probably an important skill for early hunter–gatherers, whose survival often depended on quickly identifying others as potential trading partners or foes. This pressure could have led to a tendency to distinguish between in-groups, or the group to which we belong, and out-groups, or everybody else (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="FSQD8HPTEHWKLW5AK694" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="PRACYMCF1EW5KFDA4241" data-element-id="FSQD8HPTEHWKLW5AK694">Figure 13.7</a>).

One group of students, the stereotype threat group, was told that the test accurately assessed their cognitive abilities, a statement that was designed to stimulate thinking about possible racial stereotypes about intelligence. The other group was told that the test was a routine laboratory procedure. Subsequently, the performance of Black and White students on the test was compared. After controlling for the participants’ previous Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, the Black students in the stereotype threat group performed more poorly than did the White students. In contrast, in the nonthreatening condition, Blacks and Whites with equal SAT scores performed similarly on the GRE items, which is the result that we would expect because of the tests’ reliability and validity, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-chapter-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587" data-element-id="GKXM1ATF5FWHX35BR587">Chapter 2</a> (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="VJKND1KVPN4ZQ5R81421" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="GDHUJQFA86LQB0WSR029" data-element-id="VJKND1KVPN4ZQ5R81421">Figure 13.9</a>).

In many cases, the anger over these cases has boiled over to affect entire communities and the conscience of the nation. What does psychological science tell us about these situations?</p> <p id="WTRH8CH1Y0NUSDUB0032" id-sequence="922">Research demonstrates a consistent pattern. In computer simulations, White Americans, both real police officers and college undergraduates, are more likely to “shoot” unarmed African-American than White suspects (Kenworthy, Barden, Diamond, &amp; del Carmen, 2011). In many cases, the researchers explain their results in terms of cultural stereotypes. Stereotypical views of African-American men as more dangerous might shape these quick decisions.</p> <p id="ZJWLCWUV08ZQUUQN0021" id-sequence="923">To directly assess the role of cultural stereotyping on the decision to shoot, researchers first gave participants a “personality” test that supposedly gave them a “red” or “green” personality (<span class="citation" id="PNSDTD38F284GKV7H727" id-sequence="924">Miller, Zielaskowski, &amp; Plant, 2012</span>). In actuality, participants were randomly assigned to red or green groups. In addition, participants completed a questionnaire assessing how dangerous they thought the world was. Next, the researchers presented faces of White males against a background of either red or green, which the participants were told reflected the personality of the individual. Results showed that no shooter bias occurred when participants were low to moderate in their beliefs about the danger of the world, but a bias did occur among those who saw the world as very dangerous. They were more likely to “shoot” the faces that were of the “other” personality color.</p> <p id="RGMB7NH9BCV652G56455" id-sequence="925">The researchers performed a second study using White, African-American, and Asian faces. They assumed that there would be no cultural stereotype that Asian males are dangerous. All participants were still more likely to shoot the African-American faces than the White or Asian faces, but participants with high scores on the “world is dangerous” scale were more likely to shoot Asian faces than White faces.</p> <p id="ZNXCT3Z3UGBNSTUMC906" id-sequence="926">What have we learned from this research? Certainly, these studies confirm that cultural stereotyping is an important source of influence on quick, defensive decisions. In addition, a person’s view of the world as a dangerous place is likely to accentuate a general defensiveness with regard to any out-group member. This research raises concerns about rhetoric among law enforcement personnel likening police work to combat and other factors that heighten a police officer’s sense of being in mortal danger.

</span> occurs when we simply agree to do something because another person asks us to do it, even if that person has no authority over us. From messages in junk mail that tell us to “Open immediately. Do not discard” and advertising appeals to “Buy now” to medical instructions that we receive from our dentist or family physician, we are bombarded with requests for compliance.</p> <p id="PVHZ27KK8UQH8X7JW268" id-sequence="1001">Fulfilling requests from authority figures such as teachers or police officers can provide considerable advantages to society. It is more difficult, however, to explain why people would develop the tendency to comply with requests made by strangers who have no authority. It appears that our natural tendency to affiliate leads us to behave in ways that encourage the development of relationships, including being compliant.</p> <p id="CCXJT65WBRE0H9SQK871" id-sequence="1002">Compliance is higher when factors that normally lead to the formation of relationships are present, such as perceived similarity and physical attraction. For example, we are more likely to comply with requests presented by physically attractive people (<span class="citation" id="CKGZB7684BPLXER7F240" id-sequence="1003">Lynn &amp; Simons, 2000</span>; <span class="citation" id="GZLF2MA2LW4MU3JBW369" id-sequence="1004"> McCall, 1997</span>). This behavior provides yet another example of the “Beauty is good” stereotype that influences persuasion in general. People are more likely to comply with a request from a person who shares some similarity, even when the similarity is irrelevant, such as a shared birthday (Burger, Messian, Patel, del Prado, &amp; Anderson, 2004).</p> <p id="ZGDF77M3B2K071TJT610" id-sequence="1005">Many seemingly simple yet sophisticated sales techniques exploit our natural tendencies to comply in response to perceiving a social tie with another person (<span class="citation" id="DKDT9BPDR3ZTE0QEK384" id-sequence="1006">Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004</span>). Once a sense of relationship is established, powerful norms of reciprocation are brought into play. <em>Reciprocation</em>, in which we feel obligated to give something back to people who have given something to us, is one of the most powerful tools of social influence (<span class="citation" id="LXFRN2DHWEH34PWSV375" id-sequence="1007">Gouldner, 1960</span>). The importance of reciprocation to the cohesion of early human groups probably can’t be overestimated.

    </span>
</span> is defined as compliance with the request of an authority figure. When you take an exam from a professor or show your driver’s license to a police officer, you are being obedient. The power of authorities to gain obedience is probably due to our perception of their legitimacy. Men dressed in normal attire had less influence than men dressed as security guards when making simple requests of passersby, even though the requests (“Pick up that bag” or “Give that man a dime for the parking meter”) had nothing to do with their perceived roles (<span class="citation" id="LHTP1W062ZKFB7FK9545" id-sequence="1037">Bickman, 1974</span>).</p> <p id="EMYVHQ63YELFGEX0X809" id-sequence="1038">In a series of classic experiments, Stanley Milgram attempted to demonstrate the power of authority over personal ethics (<span class="citation" id="UJZAJSNBRBSEWKAZV520" id-sequence="1039">Milgram, 1974</span>). Milgram’s participants entered his laboratory at Yale University believing that they were to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning. The other “participant” present was a confederate, and the situation was rigged so that the real participant would take the role of teacher while the confederate took the role of learner. The punishment for failing to learn pairs of words was an electric shock, to be administered by the teacher to the learner using an intimidating piece of equipment. The learner or confederate received no actual shocks; his verbal responses to shocks were prerecorded.</p> <p id="KRUN1RHT58V957ZZS458" id-sequence="1040">In most cases, Milgram’s experiment began uneventfully. However, the first challenge to the teacher occurred at 75 volts, at which time the learner’s first recorded protest could be heard. When faced with this situation, many of Milgram’s participants looked to the experimenter in the room for guidance. The experimenter assured the participant that “the experiment must continue” and “you have no choice.” Although most participants showed signs of stress and verbally stated their concerns about the procedure, all of Milgram’s original 40 participants went as far as 300 volts, and 26 out of the 40 (65%) fully complied by administering the maximum shock (450 volts). Milgram followed up his original scenario by modifying variables that might have influenced the large number of people willing to obey. No differences in outcome were observed when the experiment was conducted in an off-campus office or with participants of different ages and occupations.</p> <p id="RMEYYX3NSJ6HQXMJE609" id-sequence="1041">Among the variables that did seem to influence Milgram’s results was proximity, both between the teacher and the learner and between the teacher and the experimenter. The proximity between the teacher and the learner ranged from complete separation, in which the two people could neither see nor hear each other, to closeness, in which the teacher was instructed to physically hold the learner’s hand on a shock grid. As proximity between the teacher and the learner increased, rates of obedience dropped to about 30% (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RJPUHE6N37S8GX2TJ830" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="WVLT9J0QM6C3UCVUS437" data-element-id="RJPUHE6N37S8GX2TJ830">Figure 13.13</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf172c rs_skip" id="RJPUHE6N37S8GX2TJ830" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZYWJEAVQ0UGK12ZPD065&quot;]" id-sequence="1042"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_13_f13-t3.png" data-width="815" data-height="315"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_f13-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="228" data-alt="A horizontal bar graph shows the percentage of learners showing obedience under three conditions.

Milgram clearly demonstrated that typical people are willing to harm others under the right sets of circumstances. But did he meet his goal of modeling Nazi obedience? He believed so. You may be more comfortable thinking that people who could carry out genocide are different from the students sitting next to you in class.

We can begin to evaluate the impact of this parenting change because Milgram’s experiment has been partially replicated fairly recently by Burger (<span class="citation" id="UXWNDJUVXUFJFZADN965" id-sequence="1056">Burger, 2009</span>). By “partially replicated,” we mean that Burger made procedural changes for the purposes of meeting ethical requirements, such as informing participants that they could leave if they felt uncomfortable. Despite these changes, Burger’s results were similar to Milgram’s (82.5% of Milgram’s participants obeyed under the same circumstances in which 66.7% of Burger’s male participants obeyed). Burger’s participants were told explicitly that they could leave at any time, which raises questions about previous explanations of Milgram’s results in terms of coercion (<span class="citation" id="RCVW09ZG8WLCQXMXJ957" id-sequence="1057">Griggs, 2017</span>).</p> <p id="AKPQW01A5LJ8VUMUD870" id-sequence="1058">An alternative view of the reasons behind the behavior of Milgram’s participants suggests that something called “engaged followership” is more important than coercion (<span class="citation" id="CKTHCB1E8ZFECWRJP092" id-sequence="1059">Haslam, Reicher, Millard, &amp; McDonald, 2015</span>). In engaged followership, people are willing to do unpleasant things, so long as they agree with the objectives. Leaders, like Milgram’s experimenter, promote followers’ identification with their objectives, which makes even the most unpleasant<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_29" data-page="29"></a> tasks seem virtuous. This in turn reduces the stress experienced by the followers. This model seems to present a clearer picture of Milgram’s participants, the Nazis that he wanted to understand, and fanatic followers of many types.

Why does performance improve in front of audiences in some situations and become worse in others? Psychologists noticed that well-practiced skills, like riding a bicycle, improved with an audience, but that when people were still learning a new skill, they performed badly (<span class="citation" id="RYXXN1WGS66RBYTNK332" id-sequence="1098">Zajonc, 1968</span>; <span class="citation" id="DPRY2CJ9WABNTL44M649" id-sequence="1099"> Zajonc &amp; Sales, 1966</span>). When we’re performing a well-practiced skill, most of what we do is correct, but when we are learning something new, most of the things we do are wrong. The presence of the audience appears to enhance whichever patterns of behavior are dominant—the right moves in a well-practiced skill and the wrong moves in a new skill. The moral of this story is to make sure that you practice thoroughly before you perform in front of an audience.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_30" data-page="30"></a> <p id="HKLPTZ8KAD31Q82TZ717" id-sequence="1100">The complexity of a task also can interact with the presence of an audience to produce either improved or impaired performance (<span class="citation" id="ZECWEW2S8GT8LBRQE778" id-sequence="1101">Bond &amp; Titus, 1983</span>). This result implies that one of the functions of the audience is to increase the performer’s level of arousal.

After individually rating French leader Charles de Gaulle and Americans in general (both of which were rated somewhat positively), groups of four French college students were asked to reach consensus on the ratings and then provide a second set of individual ratings. Following the group discussion leading to consensual ratings, the students’ individual ratings were more extreme (more positive, in this example) than their first ratings had been.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:490px;height:253px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_13_f14-t2.png?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the opinion scale for DeGaulle and Americans before and after discussion.

First, conformity and desire for affiliation contribute to group polarization. If the majority of a group is leaning in a particular direction, what could be a better way of fitting in than agreeing with that majority, and maybe even taking its argument one step farther? There is also a tendency for like-minded people to affiliate with one another, which can provide reinforcement for existing opinions, increase people’s confidence in those opinions, lead to the discovery of new reasons for those opinions and counterarguments to opposing views, and reduce exposure to conflicting ideas. Second, exposure to discussion on a topic introduces new reasons for holding an attitude. If you are already opposed to gun control and you listen to additional arguments supporting your position, you might end up more opposed than you were originally.</p> <p id="FSACKWRRHWQ17VSR8430" id-sequence="1157">Group polarization is frequently studied in the context of the behaviors of juries.

Without the addition of commitment, this type of love can fade quickly. Intimacy and commitment occur together as companionate love. This love exists without passion in deep friendships, family relationships, and long-term partnerships in which sexuality no longer plays a significant role. A combination of passion and commitment can occur in an impulsive “whirlwind” relationship, in which insufficient time has elapsed for the development of true intimacy. Finally, people who are lucky enough to find all three components in the same relationship experience consummate love.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1306"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1309"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1310" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1311" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="ZNWLMFERWG87K48SS525" id-sequence="1312"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-9c</span> <span class="headingText">Maintaining Relationships</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="RNRRCRGN30HG84BVQ738_content" id-sequence="1313"> <p id="TFGKGBTDPAWXP8PAD759" id-sequence="1314">What factors keep people together?

For example, one person might bid for a response from a partner by commenting on something of personal interest, such as “Look at that beautiful dog!” The partner can turn toward the bid (“Yes, I agree. That’s a really pretty dog, but our dog is even prettier!”), away from the bid (ignoring it), or against the bid (“Don’t bother me now. I’m reading!”).

As couples spend more time together, they build a shared history, which provides them with a stronger basis for understanding each other. Couples who have been together for many years appear to have the ability to communicate a thought or emotion to each other with a single look (Schober &amp; Carstensen, 2010). Long-term relationships can become boring, however. Couples who continue to engage in novel and exciting activities have higher relationship satisfaction (<span class="citation" id="VJEFQPD17SMX3RGH8452" id-sequence="1322">Aron, Norman, Aron, McKenna, &amp; Heyman, 2000</span>).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1323"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1326"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1327" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1328" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="GZLF3VBUPNVX0MCT3247" id-sequence="1329"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-9d</span> <span class="headingText">Ending Relationships</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="SNUC49AK5FR02NN8L964_content" id-sequence="1330"> <p id="XTNBPKNL7TTT9D02B103" id-sequence="1331">As you are no doubt well aware, real life does not typically follow the scripts of fairy tales, in which the lovers ride off into the sunset to live happily ever after. Maintaining relationships takes time and effort, and sometimes people are wrong for one another. A sense of inequity or unfairness in a relationship may cause it to end. Equity in a relationship suggests that costs, such as curtailed freedom and less time to oneself, are offset by benefits, such as companionship and security. In general, more equitable romantic relationships are stable, enjoyable, and sexually intimate.</p> <p id="RKRZE8P3BAR5B0VA9710" id-sequence="1332">Most couples experience their share of ups and downs, but the relative number of their positive and negative experiences is related to the likelihood that the relationship will survive or end (<span class="citation" id="TGYQLSELUTS5VV4L5783" id-sequence="1333">Gottman, Swanson, &amp; Swanson, 2002</span>). Couples appear to need about five positive interactions to offset one negative interaction. As the ratio of positive to negative interactions slips toward 1:1, the likelihood that the relationship will end increases. Couples with high levels of apparent conflict might still stay together, so long as their conflict is offset by a larger amount of positive times together.</p> <p id="CEGEZWJAVVEPSU0AJ192" id-sequence="1334">Infidelity often contributes to the ending of a romantic relationship. Data describing how frequently romantic partners cheat on each other are difficult to obtain and show wide variations, as in the 33%–75% of men and 26%–70% of women reported to cheat on their partners in one review of the literature (<span class="citation" id="XSBLRUEBKFQ63ZSXZ491" id-sequence="1335">Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993</span>).

In other words, a woman would be less distressed if her partner had a one-night stand while drunk than if he had an ongoing relationship with a mistress whom he supported financially. In any case, relationship jealousy can have dangerous implications. More than one-third of female homicides worldwide are committed by intimate partners (Stöckl et al., 2013).</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_37" data-page="37"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf173d rs_skip" id="TPDLGRHBYX4XZHGHP392" clrenderdata="[&quot;YKYBFWZMJJYX0Q0H1020&quot;]" id-sequence="1337"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_f17-t2.png" data-width="408" data-height="311" data-alt="A vertical double bar graph shows the percentage of men and women reporting greater distress from sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity, as follows.

Three types of dispositions emerged: 17% of the participants were “cooperators,” who gave their tokens freely without paying much attention to the behavior of other group members; 20% were “free riders,” who didn’t give up any of their tokens; and 63% of the participants were “reciprocators,” who cooperated only after seeing others do so. Even though cooperators are in the minority, their behavior is important to group survival.

Because it is in our best interest to belong to effective groups, we cooperate with other group members and are quick to conform to their norms and judgments. Cooperation becomes ingrained in the group’s culture and is passed along to new members.</p> <p id="MAYMDYKUMNPZGQEGC247" id-sequence="1425">Why is cooperation so essential to successful group behavior? Without cooperation, there would be no basis for gathering diverse areas of individual expertise into a meaningful, useful whole. Under the influence of culture, humans have progressed from simple divisions of labor to highly specialized areas of expertise. Individuals might spend their entire academic careers exploring the structure of the frog retina or the surface characteristics of one of Saturn’s moons. At the same time, no single person working alone would be able to put humans on the Moon or produce all the special effects expected by contemporary movie audiences. Few fans would pay to see an individual football player demonstrate his skills on an otherwise empty field on Sunday afternoon. Cooperation is the glue that holds productive groups together, from the operating room of a hospital to the baseball diamond.</p> <p id="MLAHZZPPYYCR6PHCC559" id-sequence="1426">The importance of group membership to survival is reflected in the remarkable loyalty that humans show to their culturally defined groups. Fans of a particular sports team may be every bit as loyal to their group (and as potentially violent toward others) as our early hunter–gatherer ancestors were to their tribe or clan. Unfortunately, the same loyalty and cultural distinctiveness that bind us to our groups may lead us into conflict with other groups, as discussed later in this chapter.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1740 rs_skip" id="RYYQ5LML8MEPS6NHD511" clrenderdata="[&quot;YVWRWX4AXV8QZX0XH027&quot;]" id-sequence="1427"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf38-t2.jpg" data-width="406" data-height="264" data-alt="Four jets flying together, leaving colored jet clouds."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="NACC753QUQCGAFG8L969" id-sequence="1428"><p>Cooperation is essential to successful group behavior.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:406px;height:264px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_13_unf38-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Four jets flying together, leaving colored jet clouds." width="406" height="264" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters/Corbis </div> </div></div></div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1429"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1432"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1433" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1434" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="SYGL9E5U1AN3JMETX230" id-sequence="1435"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-10d</span> <span class="headingText">Choosing between Cooperation and Competition</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="WKLPN2LMJP6YPN7EW310_content" id-sequence="1436"> <p id="XRXBN07MBSHSG47P4794" id-sequence="1437">How do people decide when to compete and when to cooperate?</p> <p id="DKMCHR26MPQ8G1HWU766" id-sequence="1438">A classic model of competition and cooperation within groups is known as the <em>prisoner’s dilemma</em> (<span class="citation" id="SAPD4RSWQ8RL5FXMS310" id-sequence="1439">Poundstone, 1992</span>). Assume that you and another person have been arrested for a crime, but that the police have limited evidence against you. Without being able to communicate with your partner, you are given the choice to confess (defect from your partner) or to remain silent (cooperate with your partner). If you both remain silent, you will each be sentenced to 1 year. If you both confess, you will each receive 10 years. However, if one confesses and the other remains silent, the prisoner who confesses will be set free, and the silent prisoner will receive a 20-year sentence. The dilemma arises because the best individual strategy is to confess or defect from your partner, but if both of you figure this out and subsequently confess, your<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_39" data-page="39"></a> outcome is worse than if you both had remained silent (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RYUWWNYG0XU0TGWPS008" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="WKLPN2LMJP6YPN7EW310" data-element-id="RYUWWNYG0XU0TGWPS008">Figure 13.18</a>).

Using the TFT strategy, you make cooperation your first move and then repeat your partner’s successive moves. The success of the TFT strategy has been attributed to three aspects: It is nice (you begin with cooperation), it is able to retaliate and punish uncooperative behavior (defection by your partner is followed by your own defection), and it is forgiving (you return immediately to cooperation following cooperation on the part of your partner (<span class="citation" id="HPDUJV9XEXKFR8JS3225" id-sequence="1444">Brembs, 1996</span>).</p> <p id="ZWNF5BSXCHRJTQMLG098" id-sequence="1445">The research on individual differences in cooperation discussed earlier found that most human participants were reciprocators, whose behavior is most similar to the TFT strategy (<span class="citation" id="STAFQZJFSZHAS11NQ116" id-sequence="1446">Kurzban &amp; Houser, 2005</span>). The prevalence of this type might reflect its typical success. If most people are reciprocators, how can we explain the existence of the other types? Free riders clearly benefit from their selfish behavior, but what advantages might increase the chances of the cooperators’ survival and reproductive success? It is easier to be generous when you are well off, so acting like a cooperator might make people believe that you have extensive resources, improving your chances of attracting a mate (<span class="citation" id="WHHZFDFZNLP126A1Z146" id-sequence="1447">Milinski, Semmann, &amp; Jrambeck, 2002</span>). A person’s reputation is also a powerful motivator for cooperation. In ongoing prisoner’s dilemma games, participants use other people’s record of cooperation (or lack thereof) to determine whether to cooperate with them (<span class="citation" id="BQGMNW8L1TV5Q0NKF422" id-sequence="1448">Milinski et al., 2002</span>).

Although these reports were not confirmed by later court testimony in the case (<span class="citation" id="HHUSCC6EXVM8S2T79091" id-sequence="1486">Manning, Levine, &amp; Collins, 2007</span>), the public outrage that they stimulated led to a series of experiments into <a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1292" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1292"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1292" id="QLLKKY1PPTCSAJZ0M170" id-sequence="1487"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">bystander intervention</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="FDUZ3ADY4STQ6UAFD101" id-sequence="1488">bystander intervention</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">The study of situational variables related to helping a stranger, most notably the decreased likelihood of helping as the number of bystanders increases</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1292">

</span>. This research demonstrated that an individual’s likelihood of helping drops as the number of other observers grows. In a typical experiment<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_41" data-page="41"></a> investigating this phenomenon, college students filled out a questionnaire as their room filled with smoke (Latané &amp; Darley, 1968). The researchers were interested in how frequently and quickly the students reported the smoke. When the college students were alone, nearly 80% sought help within 6 minutes. When three study participants were tested together, however, only 40% reported the emergency within 6 minutes.</p> <p id="UDSTMZN7RB7YTNZ1Q074" id-sequence="1489">The effect of the number of observers on the likelihood of intervention is probably influenced by a sense of individual responsibility. When you are the only person available to help, your responsibility is clear. When a crowd of people is gathered around the scene of an accident, it is easier to assume that others have already called 911 or that a physician or nurse who is better qualified to help will be present. People also fail to act because of fears of appearing foolish as a result of misinterpreting a situation. Emergencies sometimes can be ambiguous. What sounds like a case of domestic violence next door might be a loud movie or video game or actors practicing a scene for a play. People who feel anonymous are less likely to help, which is consistent with our previous observations of how anonymity can lead to less socially desirable behavior. Finally, people are more likely to help when it is safe and convenient for them to do so. If you are heading for your car at the end of the day when you notice a classmate with a flat tire, you are likely to lend a hand. However, if you are late for work or a final exam, you may conveniently assume that someone else will take care of the situation as you continue on your way.</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1490"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1493"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1494" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1495" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="QGQWWDBLN81CMGEF8737" id-sequence="1496"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-11</span> <span class="headingText">Why Are We Aggressive?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="MMXAZX4XRQYKHGYA2272_content" id-sequence="1497"> <p id="SLJHBYT91A32C49C4584" id-sequence="1498"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1293" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1293"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1293" id="WXMHPMWU648LGWC8A597" id-sequence="1499"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Aggression</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="PWPYP8AP6DJ03Y69V752" id-sequence="1500">Aggression</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">The conscious intent to harm another.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1293">

</span> is the conscious intent to harm others, and it can take several forms. Instrumental aggression is the intentional harm, usually physical, done to others to obtain a goal, such as attacking a person to steal a wallet or purse. Relational aggression harms another person’s social standing through behaviors such as ignoring, excluding, and gossiping. Other types of aggression include defensive aggression, in which the person may do harm to others in self-defense; passive aggression, in which people who aren’t comfortable being openly aggressive get what they want under the guise of still trying to please others; and maternal aggression, a rather common phenomenon in the animal world (and occasionally among humans) in which sickly or unwanted offspring are killed.</p> <p id="FFRLKEW2FGGF5R7BE112" id-sequence="1501">Like most of the behaviors discussed in this textbook, factors leading to human aggression form complex interactions. Efforts to find simple correlations between violence and single variables such as economic growth, population trends, illegal drug trade, availability of guns, and domestic violence versus stranger violence do not tell the whole story. We can capture the flavor of this complexity by examining homicide rates across cultures. The average homicide rate worldwide is about 10 per 100,000 residents per year, or twice the number killed in war (UNODC, 2014). South Africa has a murder rate of 60 homicides per 100,000 residents, compared to Singapore’s rate of 0.2 per 100,000 (UNODC, 2014). Rates in large cities within the United States vary substantially, from 50.3 homicides per 100,000 residents of St. Louis, Missouri, to 0.4 per 100,000 in Honolulu (FBI, 2010). Across all cultures, women are more likely than men to be killed by intimate partners or family members, but rates again vary. Only 24% of female victims in Australia are killed by someone they don’t know, while 66% of female victims in Singapore don’t know their murderer (UNODC, 2014).</p> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="1502"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="1505"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="1506" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="1507" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="JYDXENUQA2VDSSAC9674" id-sequence="1508"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">13-11a</span> <span class="headingText">The Biological Psychology of Aggression</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="QCQNUWY7WYM9ML57W286_content" id-sequence="1509"> <p id="CMRL4DRHT7551B5PY159" id-sequence="1510">Is a capacity for aggression simply part of being human?

Human twin and adoption studies imply that aggressive tendencies in humans are at least partly influenced by genetics (Rushton, Fulker, Neale, Nias, &amp;<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_42" data-page="42"></a> Eysenck, 1986). As we have seen so frequently in this textbook, genes associated with aggressive behavior interact with nurture or experience. Among children who were abused, those with one version of a gene linked to aggression in animals were likely to behave aggressively, while those with the other form rarely did so, even when the abuse experienced was severe (<span class="citation" id="KJCDHV1RW92AA4QDR250" id-sequence="1513">Craig, 2007</span>; <span class="citation" id="PSQCTBZHCGUPNB28P387" id-sequence="1514"> Fergusson, Boden, Horwood, Miller, &amp; Kennedy, 2011</span>).</p> <p id="TXUSAWWNHTKXYM9K5677" id-sequence="1515">Both naturally occurring chemicals and recreational drugs can influence aggression. Among the naturally occurring chemicals implicated in aggression are androgens, or male hormones such as testosterone (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="CAGA3R0BKARLHRN7Q273" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="QCQNUWY7WYM9ML57W286" data-element-id="CAGA3R0BKARLHRN7Q273">Figure 13.19</a>). Prenatal exposure to high levels of androgens, which can occur naturally or because of medications occasionally given to pregnant women, increases the aggressive play of both male and female preschoolers (Reinisch, Ziemba-Davis, &amp; Sanders, 1991). Adult men with higher levels of prenatal testosterone exposure score higher on standardized questionnaires of aggression (<span class="citation" id="NWBVT8PVASK628RWF295" id-sequence="1516">Bailey &amp; Hurd, 2005</span>; <span class="citation" id="VUBKNUQ61ATBNU9XD287" id-sequence="1517"> Burton, Henninger, Hafetz, &amp; Cofer, 2009</span>).

The nonabused individuals showed an unusually reduced level of activity in the frontal lobes. Given the essential role of the frontal lobes in higher-order judgment and impulse control, this lower level of activity might help account for their inability to control their aggression.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1746 rs_skip" id="DRTLC8R5FV8CB2BEU210" clrenderdata="[&quot;PHQF43E46M2RDCGWX251&quot;]" id-sequence="1534"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf42-t2.png" data-width="503" data-height="208" data-alt="Three scans showing the brain activity of three people. a) has no history of criminal behavior, b) convicted of murder and with a history of childhood abuse and c) convicted of murder with no history of childhood abuse."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered wide"><div class="mediaDescription" id="RAYC4QDSDCH0W5L67912" id-sequence="1535"><p>These brain images were taken from (a) a person with no history of criminal behavior, (b) a person who was convicted of murder and had a strong history of childhood abuse and neglect, and (c) a person who was convicted of murder but had no history of childhood abuse or neglect.

Cross-cultural data show that homicide rates are often high in cultures that feature a loving socialization of children and aversion to interpersonal conflict, such as the Inuit, !Kung Bushmen, and Gebusi of New Zealand, yet very low among cultures where children are explicitly taught to fight, like the Turkana of Kenya (Dyson-Hudson &amp; Dyson-Hudson, 1999; Dyson-Hudson &amp; Dyson-Hudson, 1995).</p> <p id="PJMQ8D620949M301Q284" id-sequence="1567">Much of the research discussed so far in this chapter focuses on individual variables, whether they are related to a person’s genetic makeup or socialization. To truly understand aggression, we need to zoom out to see this behavior within the social context. For example, we know that if groups rarely interact, they are more likely to fight than to cooperate. In contrast, if groups interact regularly and anticipate future interactions, they may still compete, but they tend to do so in more prosocial ways.</p> <p id="GEYN2R9BWF1MWG2LL583" id-sequence="1568">The social environment also can determine whether aggressiveness escalates to actual violence. In a study using surveillance footage of public places, researchers observed actual fighting behavior (<span class="citation" id="YGERB408FW7LACH20443" id-sequence="1569">Levine, Taylor, &amp; Best, 2011</span>). In many cases, one or more third parties (usually friends of the combatants) intervened to stop the fight. In an interesting contrast with the helping behavior observed in the bystander intervention literature discussed previously, third parties are more likely, not less likely, to intervene in a fight when the number of bystanders is larger. Perhaps the implications of the aggression spreading to include the whole group makes stopping the fight a very high priority for members of the group.</p><a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_45" data-page="45"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1748 rs_skip" id="UVGHY4F85VAN3JYCC334" clrenderdata="[&quot;XHZEPTWYB2G0HRCP8474&quot;]" id-sequence="1570"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_13_unf44-t2.jpg" data-width="503" data-height="328" data-alt="Homicides among the Turkana of Kenya are quite rare, even though children are explicitly encouraged to be aggressive toward one another, under the watchful eyes of adults.

Classic research reviewed earlier in this chapter showed that Americans typically married someone who lived within five blocks of their home (<span class="citation" id="SKSDBVF18ZQQSFU6U013" id-sequence="1578">Bossard, 1932</span>). The Internet has changed all of that. Between 2005 and 2012, a surprising number of Americans, one out of three, met their spouses online (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Gonzaga, Ogburn, &amp; VanderWeele, 2013). Despite the comfort level of younger adults with the Internet, 30- to 39-year-olds were more likely to have met their spouse online than were those under 30. Those who met their spouse online were also more educated and had higher incomes, suggesting that the Internet has provided busy people opportunities to socialize.</p> <p id="AMLJSAEVKZEZQ0ZK3208" id-sequence="1579">Marriages begun online were slightly but significantly less likely to end in divorce or separation than marriages begun offline (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="EJWD0MYW4Q6LYVKKK123" data-chapter-id="BBLGBK492RKVKCW59377" data-section-id="GXAWX03QT1V7AM9KQ541" data-element-id="EJWD0MYW4Q6LYVKKK123">Figure 13.20</a>). Online marriage partners rated their marriages as more satisfying.

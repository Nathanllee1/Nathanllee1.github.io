Children with two short alleles (SS) were more likely than children with either a combination of alleles (SL) or two long alleles (LL) to react negatively to the experience of being bullied frequently (<span class="citation" id="SSKKWJAMBVY3MMN5B273" id-sequence="31">Sugden et al., 2010</span>). Zooming out to the map of the world, you can see that these genotypes are not equally distributed worldwide. Yellow areas on the map have low frequencies of the S allele, and orange and red areas have higher frequencies. South Africa has a relatively small number of people with the S allele (28%) compared to the United States, Australia, and Great Britain (about 40 to 45%), which in turn have many fewer than China (about 80%).</p> <p id="ESUJYN8HANJ3G3KX6315" id-sequence="32">Besides having different distributions of the serotonin transporter gene alleles, what else do you know about these cultures? If you thought about these cultures as differing in individualism versus collectivism, you are correct. Although some cultures with lower frequencies of the S allele have more collectivistic cultures than the United States, there is a positive correlation between the percentage of S allele carriers and a culture’s rating on a scale from individualistic to collectivistic (<span class="citation" id="NWMBHQRLX7GJWCFQ2614" id-sequence="33">Chiao &amp; Blizinsky, 2010</span>). Why would this be the case? Like all correlations, multiple relationships among genetic profiles and culture ratings are possible, and we cannot<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_457" data-page="457"></a> make conclusions about causes for these relationships. A population with a certain genetic mix might be more likely to form a particular type of culture, a culture might shape the reproductive success of its members, some outside variable could influence both the genetic mix and the form of the culture, or some combination of these factors could influence one another simultaneously (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="LDRN9PHW7K2PV1DGS205" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-section-id="XYFCPNNFJYTTPM1CJ658" data-element-id="LDRN9PHW7K2PV1DGS205">Figure 12.1</a>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16cb rs_skip" id="UFWG0AB63K7P9BHQL487" clrenderdata="[&quot;KMPQUDCKT89FRABVQ874&quot;]" id-sequence="34"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf02-t2.jpg" data-width="250" data-height="362" data-alt="Asians have a much higher probability of having the S allele of the serotonin transporter gene than do people living in many other parts of the world."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="WQZZNWM0QLXMKBFWL794" id-sequence="35"><p>Asians have a much higher probability of having the S allele of the serotonin transporter gene than do people living in many other parts of the world.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:250px;height:362px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_12_unf02-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Asians have a much higher probability of having the S allele of the serotonin transporter gene than do people living in many other parts of the world." width="250" height="362" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">Glow Asia RF/Alamy Stock Photo </div> </div></div></div> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16cc rs_skip" id="LDRN9PHW7K2PV1DGS205" clrenderdata="[&quot;AETW5LC5TNER2BBPT863&quot;]" id-sequence="36"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_f01-t2.png" data-width="427" data-height="351" data-alt="A graph shows the relation between individualism collectivism and the percentage of population with S allele in various countries.

For example, when we use the defense mechanism of sublimation, we redirect negative energy. An aggressive teen might take up martial arts rather than starting fights at school.

These theorists brought the psychodynamic approach closer to contemporary views of humans as social animals, a theme we discuss throughout this textbook.

For example, a person might overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by purchasing a fancy, expensive automobile. Adler was also one of the first psychologists to suggest that siblings, along with parents, influence development, leading to investigations of the effects of birth order.

</span> into two components. The personal unconscious remained the same as Freud’s unconscious mind. Jung added a deeper level, the collective unconscious, composed of our common psychological predispositions as humans passed from generation to generation (<span class="citation" id="WAAKL4ZMX9WGQM237840" id-sequence="141">Jung, 1928</span>). After observing common themes in cultures around the world during his extensive travels, Jung argued that generations of experience with concepts such as darkness, power, death, and parents would lead to characteristic ways of unconsciously thinking about such topics. Jung’s ideas are echoed in today’s evolutionary approach to psychology, which views the mind as having adapted over the course of evolution (<span class="citation" id="PMQUYPKS1ANPKW8UQ540" id-sequence="142">Walters, 1994</span>).</p> <p id="FWJJ867AVQL7C6HLJ021" id-sequence="143">In addition to his expansion of the concept of the unconscious, Jung deviated from Freud by providing more specific information about differences in individual personality. In particular, Jung’s concepts of the personality characteristics of extroversion (outgoing) and introversion (relatively less outgoing) are still very much alive in current discussions of personality. Jung’s personality characteristics form the basis for several popular personality tests, such as the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Unfortunately, as we will see later, the MBTI does not hold up well to analyses of validity and reliability.</p> <p id="CBVLGKN46NM7WRTTR094" id-sequence="144">Karen Horney (1885–1952) was one of the first female psychiatrists. Horney rejected many of Freud’s ideas to concentrate on aspects of culture that contribute to women’s feelings of inferiority. Simultaneously, while treating male patients, Horney became convinced that men envied women’s ability to become pregnant and be mothers. Her emphasis on the impact of a male-dominated society on women helped set the stage for many subsequent feminist scholars (Horney, 1923–1937/1967, 1950).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16d2 rs_skip" id="BVQS3LZZWW8UTJL4E354" clrenderdata="[&quot;SYFP9S8TDS2721RA0079&quot;]" id-sequence="145"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf05-t2.jpg" data-width="370" data-height="239" data-alt="Alfred Adler suggested that an inferiority complex can lead to overcompensation in the form of seeking the appearance of superiority. “Man heels” that add at least 2 inches of height have become increasingly popular and are worn frequently by Hollywood stars."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="LNDTVJ2A41H9YBH7K613" id-sequence="146"><p>Alfred Adler suggested that an inferiority complex can lead to overcompensation in the form of seeking the appearance of superiority. “Man heels” that add at least 2 inches of height have become increasingly popular and are worn frequently by Hollywood stars.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:370px;height:239px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_12_unf05-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Alfred Adler suggested that an inferiority complex can lead to overcompensation in the form of seeking the appearance of superiority. “Man heels” that add at least 2 inches of height have become increasingly popular and are worn frequently by Hollywood stars." width="370" height="239" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">AP Images/A yue gz/Imaginechina </div> </div></div></div> </div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="147"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="150"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="151" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="152" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h2 id="ZVGPDZWEEVYQC20A8662" id-sequence="153"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">12-2b</span> <span class="headingText">Classic Behaviorist Approaches to Personality</span></h2></div><div class="content" id="QEFQTZFRJRBUJG4EF163_content" id-sequence="154"> <p id="ZFJS5U26KHB3KA2QM441" id-sequence="155">Behaviorist approaches to personality emphasized learning as an important influence on personality development.

Humanistic psychologists were convinced that humans are unique, and they argued that the animal research favored by behaviorists was irrelevant. The humanistic psychologists’ belief that human nature is basically good contrasts dramatically with the darker view of human nature put forward by Freud and other psychodynamic theorists. Humanistic psychologists believed that psychodynamic theories placed too much emphasis on abnormal behavior. Instead, they advocated studying exceptional people to see why they succeeded, a tactic continued by contemporary positive psychology approaches, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-chapter-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075" data-element-id="RCMS7QP9S507BLW28075">Chapter 16</a>.</p> <p id="MASU0GF9KR29WGQ18270" id-sequence="172">One of the leading humanistic psychologists, Abraham Maslow, was interested in motivation, and we discussed his contributions to this area in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-chapter-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189" data-element-id="XKHL3QC5PGZGPGMSD189">Chapter 7</a>.

In addition to expected characteristics, such as creativity, realistic thinking, and concern for others, Maslow’s exceptional people had some surprising qualities. They had few friends, well-developed senses of humor, and periodic mystic or peak experiences.</p> <p id="GPGSUJGCF6CAQBBER586" id-sequence="174">Carl Rogers (1951, 1980), another humanistic psychologist, put forward a theory of personality based on his experience as a therapist.

Rogers, like Maslow, believed that humans strive toward self-actualization or maximizing their individual potential. For Rogers, people who follow the path laid out by their feelings will lead productive, healthy lives. They will experience congruence, or similarity, between their real selves and their ideal selves. Congruence is most likely to occur in response to unconditional positive regard, or a nonjudgmental appreciation for a person’s true nature. Being treated judgmentally makes people act in ways that are incongruent or inconsistent with their ideal selves, which might lead to disordered behaviors (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="XESWH690UL463JZTE727" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-section-id="RYCZXWXW7030ER9HW205" data-element-id="XESWH690UL463JZTE727">Figure 12.5</a>).</p> <a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_464" data-page="464"></a> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16d5 rs_skip" id="XESWH690UL463JZTE727" clrenderdata="[&quot;UDNZFS0UT88S802TQ322&quot;]" id-sequence="175"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_f100-t2.png" data-width="521" data-height="181" data-alt="An illustration shows Carl Rogers’ Humanistic Theory of Personality.

They are interested in exploring aspects of life that are different from their own, whether this means trying new foods, traveling to exotic locations, or studying other religions. People low on openness are more practical, traditional, and conforming. They prefer the familiar over the new, choosing a chain restaurant in a new city rather than experimenting with the local cuisine.</p> <p id="LEJNG2QEXT14NSLAX000" id-sequence="229"><a role="link" href="javascript://" data-annotation-id="5caf90f30ec112076ccf1225" class="clui_glossary_link glossary_link_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1225"><span class="glossary nbannotation nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1225" id="JFJDQ0UEKF1PSMU8M604" id-sequence="230"><span class="index nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">Conscientiousness</span><span class="term"><span class="primaryTerm" id="TMBNT50V89Q30Q061719" id-sequence="231">Conscientiousness</span></span><span class="definition nb_hidden clAnnotationDecoration rs_skip">A Big Five personality trait characterized by competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation.</span></span></a><span class="glossaryContainer clAnnotationDecoration footnotediv rs_skip" style="display:none" id="glossaryContainer_5caf90f30ec112076ccf1225">

More recent work has demonstrated an increasing respect for the influences of situational variables on behavior. Personality may predict typical behaviors performed by individuals, but situations<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_469" data-page="469"></a> often provide better insight into cases in which people behave in uncharacteristic ways (Sherman, Rauthmann, Brown, Serfass, &amp; Jones, 2015). As predicted by Lewin, personality and situations usually interact. For example, individual personality traits influence the types of situations we choose to encounter as well as the way we think about those situations, which in turn reinforces the original personality traits (<span class="citation" id="PHUQ6HPCY26P0TT6K460" id-sequence="547">Rauthmann, Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2015</span>). In other cases, the power of situations can have large and lasting effects on personality. For example, the experience of unemployment produced long-term changes in individual levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness (<span class="citation" id="SEZR8B9UG8EXF5T2K461" id-sequence="548">Boyce, Wood, Daly, &amp; Sedikides, 2015</span>).</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16da rs_skip" id="XBEJF99V0PULZEN58706" clrenderdata="[&quot;LFREW9NMN239T3HVK681&quot;]" id-sequence="549"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf10-t2.jpg" data-width="317" data-height="408" data-alt="A photo shows a man fixing a car’s engine while two women look on over his shoulder."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="HBFZ0ME6HG6917XPZ323" id-sequence="550"><p>Is this man helping these women because of his individual personality traits?

At least in the case of fish, individual personality is sometimes suppressed in groups in favor of the collective decisions of the school (<span class="citation" id="YGVCD2QX8WH0W9FMX574" id-sequence="553">McDonald, Rands, Hill, Elder, &amp; Ioannou, 2016</span>). Fish, like humans, show individual differences in “boldness,” or the willingness to accept reward over risk. The boldness of individual fish tested alone is quite consistent, but the behavior of the same fish within a school of fish is not. This suggests that at least in the area of risk-taking, testing individuals might give psychologists very different results than testing the same people in a group setting.</p> <p id="JZMML68FQT1WMRX76949" id-sequence="554">Midway in the 20th century, some behaviorists began to think in more cognitive terms and believed that learning theories of personality had neglected motivations, emotions, and cognitions. These behaviorists recognized the importance of personality in social contexts, where behavior is shaped and rewarded by interactions with other people.

Like other social–cognitive learning theorists, Bandura rejected the strict behaviorism of Skinner as applied to personality. He agreed with Skinner that the environment can determine behavior but thought that it does so reciprocally, as people influence the environment through both their internal cognitions and their behavior.</p> <p id="NRYPDDX6VMYQE0103265" id-sequence="585">Bandura believed that observation of others’ behavior played an important role in the development of personality. Although much of his work centered on aggression, Bandura believed that many other characteristics were learned in this same manner. He was particularly interested in self-efficacy (<span class="citation" id="UKFGBKHMQQU84U6RQ982" id-sequence="586">Bandura, 1990</span>, <span class="citation" id="XFHXFWYAPYS1TKMHJ014" id-sequence="587"> 1993</span>, <span class="citation" id="FQHK76S2UHFZEZZNC409" id-sequence="588"> 1995</span>). This characteristic refers to confidence in your abilities to gain reinforcement. If self-efficacy is high, you have strong expectations that positive outcomes are within reach. If you study hard and get good grades, you expect to obtain a good job in your chosen career. However, if self-efficacy is low, you might doubt your abilities to reach your goals. Self-efficacy can be situation specific. You might be confident<a data-type="pageEnd" name="PageEnd_470" data-page="470"></a> in your abilities in science but less so in your abilities in rock climbing. Self-efficacy influences a person’s environment and experiences. A confident job candidate is probably more likely to be hired than an applicant who appears insecure.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16db rs_skip" id="GBWDS9NTQ6PUQLWZE491" clrenderdata="[&quot;RHXZNSNLV4GL6PS6Y426&quot;]" id-sequence="589"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf11-t2.jpg" data-width="280" data-height="338" data-alt="A photo shows a homeless person holding up a placard with a message for help that reads, homeless anything helps thank u."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="DXGLKJ56S9LUMWCVP811" id-sequence="590"><p>People with an internal locus of control believe that most of our outcomes are due to our own efforts, while people with an external locus of control believe that our outcomes are more often due to factors beyond our control.

For example, when 51 boys at a summer camp were observed, their extroversion–introversion scores did not predict their extroverted or introverted behaviors across 21 situations (<span class="citation" id="FDFRSAGGFMNA9LUCD970" id-sequence="601">Newcombe, 1929</span>). Instead of focusing on traits alone, Mischel argued that the stability we expect in a person’s behavior arises from that individual’s characteristic way of interpreting situations (<span class="citation" id="EDQQV5K91JHYQSZNA691" id-sequence="602">Mischel, 2004</span>).</p> <p id="LQHJPW6B8HZA8M1JM925" id-sequence="603">To illustrate this process, consider two children who both score high on some measure of aggression.

Instead, an individual child’s behavior can be predicted by considering “if–then” relationships between situations and behavior (<span class="citation" id="QUBYKTAPQZ3HNBXNM633" id-sequence="605">Mischel &amp; Shoda, 1995</span>). One child may be aggressive when approached by peers but respond passively to an adult’s efforts to apply discipline, while another might show the opposite pattern. In other words, <em>if</em> the child experiences a particular situation (interacting with peers or adults), that child <em>then</em> responds with a unique, stable set of behaviors (aggressive or passive). These if–then patterns are characteristic of an individual, leading to the stable characteristics we think of as personality.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16dc rs_skip" id="GUGWB57ZJ9W9FEP7F556" clrenderdata="[&quot;ZFQPT38BQDQDJPA99942&quot;]" id-sequence="606"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf12-t2.jpg" data-width="380" data-height="183" data-alt="Self-efficacy is the belief that you can handle a challenging situation and obtain future rewards."></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"><div class="mediaDescription" id="ZWLNW99P37ELWPXWR614" id-sequence="607"><p>Self-efficacy is the belief that you can handle a challenging situation and obtain future rewards.</p></div> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:380px;height:183px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_12_unf12-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Self-efficacy is the belief that you can handle a challenging situation and obtain future rewards." width="380" height="183" class="rs_skip"></div><div class="mediaCredit">GABRIEL BOUYS/Getty Images </div> </div></div></div> <div class="footnotes"></div></div><div id="footer" id-sequence="608"></div></div><div class="container page "><div id="header" id-sequence="611"><div id="breadcrumb-old" id-sequence="612" class="rs_skip" style="display: none;"><a id="chapterTitle" href="javascript://" data-link-type="outline" id-sequence="613" class="reader_toolbar_button" tabindex="1" role="button" aria-label="Chapter contents"></a></div><h1 id="FSWM2KNBWWAMDELFP392" id-sequence="614"><span class="sectionLabel rs_skip">12-5</span> <span class="headingText">What Are the Biological Bases of Personality?</span></h1></div><div class="content" id="JXUMDJVZDMUMMV6UZ634_content" id-sequence="615"> <p id="GFGX2KQDZMELW7NYE232" id-sequence="616">Biological theories of personality build bridges between observed traits and their underlying biological correlates.

Reactivity describes differences in people’s responses to novel or challenging stimuli. People’s responses may vary in terms of both intensity and timing. Some people respond to such stimuli immediately with highly intense anxiety, others respond more slowly, and some barely notice the stimuli. Self-regulation involves the ability to control attention and inhibit responding to perceived stimuli. These dimensions of temperament appear to be related to the Big Five traits. Higher reactivity is characteristic of introversion and neuroticism (<span class="citation" id="XGMM8ZQM0061G9DU2882" id-sequence="658">Aron et al., 2010</span>), while self-regulation is associated with later conscientiousness (Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, &amp; Posner, 2011).

People with schizophrenia, but not others, are likely to agree with the statement “I seem to hear things that other people can’t hear.” Although the MMPI was designed to assist with clinical diagnosis, this is only one of its present-day uses.

Validity describes how well a test measures what it is supposed to measure.

If the MBTI is a valid model, the factor analysis should identify the four clusters, answers to the questions associated with each cluster should be highly correlated with each other, and the questions that fit in a cluster statistically should make sense. In other words, an item stating, “I like to be the life of the party” should be found in the extroversion– introversion cluster (<span class="citation" id="HDXBYB5Q88LEYFZAE220" id-sequence="811">Pittenger, 1993</span>).

Unfortunately, there is no evidence that certain MBTI types are more successful than others in an occupation, that certain types are more satisfied with their occupations, or that certain types remain in their occupation longer (<span class="citation" id="DXNL736U604B05EC7902" id-sequence="813">Pittenger, 1993</span>).</p> <p id="DQSQAEUTTD20GGSK1565" id-sequence="814">What about the reliability of the MBTI? If your personality as measured by the MBTI is stable, we would expect little variation as you take the test multiple times. However, even with test–retest intervals as short as 5 weeks, as many as 50% of all test takers will be classified into different types on the second try (<span class="citation" id="RVTGRUAJNCRCQW4A0775" id-sequence="815">Pittenger, 1993</span>).</p> <p id="VXVM1QREY28AD52ES880" id-sequence="816">This leaves us wondering why tests that do not meet the standard criteria for validity and reliability are still used. Why is the Rorschach Inkblot Test still admissible to American courts of law? Why do employers invest in the MBTI for their employees? One reason is our love of insight, which drives otherwise reasonable people to consult horoscopes, tarot cards, palm readers, and crystal balls. Upon receiving a description of their MBTI profile, many people have an “aha” moment, but the same could be said of horoscopes. In fairness, however, tests like the MBTI are so well marketed and used by so many reputable institutions that it is natural for the public to feel a level of trust (see <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="YRTTHJLCZBGR1YHYG153" data-chapter-id="XFYTLYJ7QBE18S9RL196" data-section-id="TBCBG98PPE4Q33GZM415" data-element-id="YRTTHJLCZBGR1YHYG153">Figure 12.15</a>).</p> <div class="figure" id="YRTTHJLCZBGR1YHYG153" id-sequence="817"> <div class="heading"><span class="label">Figure <span class="ordinal">12.15</span></span> <h3 id="XGMXURP1F43TY7RBT018" id-sequence="818">What Not to Do with a Personality Test.</h3> <div class="caption" id="UNGUKUXJ3H0XHPZV3897" id-sequence="819"><p>Not only is the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator questionable in terms of validity and reliability, but this real-world application of the test to an automobile customer’s choice for a “hands-free, foot-activated liftgate” in her car is not in the best scientific tradition.</p></div></div> <div class="table rs_skip" id="DCYUPSX6LQEQ2LTD5529" id-sequence="820"> <div class="maintable narrowtable" style="height: auto;"><table data-width="360" style="width: 480px;"> <colgroup><col width="160"><col width="133"><col width="93"><col width="93"></colgroup> <tbody id="GPSWQXQPW0KWAWAKB518" id-sequence="821"> <tr class="odd" id="MSLDJND5E77EU7P2D366" id-sequence="822"> <th id="CYYPYC29T8WC2Q2VS949" colspan="3" class="alignleft valigntop" id-sequence="823">Applied to a Target Customer</th> <td id="UQHYSD3QTEDCTZRFS074" rowspan="2" class="aligncenter valignbottom" id-sequence="824"><div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16ea rs_skip" id="HGUQ7YSQHZRCBYEUG224" clrenderdata="[&quot;UFUYYPMZ2W6F2HBZS187&quot;]" id-sequence="825"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_f15-t2.jpg" data-width="118" data-height="129" data-alt="Projective Tests"></div><div class="nb_media image unnumbered"> <div class="imageContainer" style="width:118px;height:129px;"><img src="https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/psychology/cacioppo_9781337561815/images/61815_12_f15-t2.jpg?token=CD3844E30A003ECCC8072FDCEBF1AF87B73C16E22CD8E66F1BBC9079F5332520647C926E3C0A22A1EFABFAB73B212D68500C0588FA9F8473D3873F90032592142553C89742879D35" alt="Projective Tests" width="118" height="129" class="rs_skip"></div></div></div></div></td> </tr> <tr class="even" id="ZYZJDNAG6DCVRB0ZP133" id-sequence="826"> <td id="TDVBH8QMUC62RUMTM592" colspan="3" class="alignleft valigntop" id-sequence="827"><p>As a fun example of how this works, let’s analyze Carrie—she’s an ESFP and the target customer for the Ford Escape compact utility vehicle</p></td> </tr> <tr class="odd" id="FCDF6DZGQFNW3LRT1246" id-sequence="828"> <th id="NAYCHBVSE95E60YG1165" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore" id-sequence="829">Personal characteristics</th> <th id="LKQUMQF3KEWHLPXD0573" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore" id-sequence="830">Myers-Briggs preference</th> <th id="QHAD6GNX7QBRZ805W497" class="alignleft valigntop" id-sequence="831">Favorite feature</th> <th id="UGSNJ1N6C676MDCP8966" class="aligncenter valigntop" id-sequence="832">ESFP</th> </tr> <tr class="even" id="BXHL66XFUKH9K00UQ948" id-sequence="833"> <td id="FXVYEA9NEHDDEHLBC225" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="834"><p>Outgoing and social</p></td> <td id="WTHGY208NVA6YHKF2279" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="835"><p><strong>E</strong>xtraversion</p></td> <td id="RBMGWKDUUB7WE24W9220" colspan="2" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="836"><p>Spacious seating for five friends</p></td> </tr> <tr class="odd" id="QKHB8W9QQ5P03JYSM251" id-sequence="837"> <td id="JNEDNAE8W03JARBAP188" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="838"><p>She lives in the moment and travels to experience life</p></td> <td id="DYUGYBAS6HT23WPX9677" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="839"><p><strong>S</strong>ensing</p></td> <td id="DHJYJQ437G3W6XWGJ394" colspan="2" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="840"><p>Her powerful EcoBoost engine delivers the fuel efficiency to feed her curiousity</p></td> </tr> <tr class="even" id="YMGECG6MRWJQBG57F382" id-sequence="841"> <td id="QRUGKHKSY4D151P7T618" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="842"><p>Stays true to her values, beliefs and ideals</p></td> <td id="PUMR0MPGZ51H2DCZM710" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore underscore" id-sequence="843"><p><strong>F</strong>eeling</p></td> <td id="PQNAZGM3C9G7SP9VY966" colspan="2" class="alignleft valigntop underscore" id-sequence="844"><p>Intelligent 4WD system helps the vehicle stay grounded</p></td> </tr> <tr class="odd" id="TEDREQGGB7128BQ58710" id-sequence="845"> <td id="NNEYT9SG7528BKW7M996" class="alignleft valigntop sidescore" id-sequence="846"><p>“I know marriage and family is in my future.

Who gets to see these data? How are they stored? For what purposes may they be used? Is the examiner trained in the administration and evaluation of tests? In many cases, such as in the use of the MMPI, sensitive and private data are generated. In other cases, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the results are at best controversial. This widely used test has described normal children as having problems approaching psychosis (<span class="citation" id="FTBW1BQ6YFDJV9V3H507" id-sequence="860">Garb, Wood, Lilienfeld, &amp; Nezworski, 2005</span>; <span class="citation" id="SWXEGU1NZ4MNZ7GRS375" id-sequence="861"> Hamel, Shaffer, &amp; Erdberg, 2000</span>).

between our self and others. William James (1890, p. 330) argued in favor of “the belief in a distinct principle of selfhood” and believed that such a principle could be studied scientifically. Knowing something about the personalities of others makes it easier for us to anticipate what others will feel, think, or do and, therefore, to interact more effectively with them. But what about the patterns of thought, feelings, and actions we see in ourselves?

Having a self means having a sense of unity, or of being a single human. The self incorporates a history or a sense of continuity. This aspect of self helps us organize our personal knowledge on a timeline, providing us with a past, present, and future. A sense of embodiment means that the self is embedded in the body (as opposed to the sensation of having an out-of-body experience, discussed in <a href="javascript://" data-link-type="bookmark" data-isbn="9781337561815" data-link-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-chapter-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957" data-element-id="MQJZJ4JJN52VRSCZ7957">Chapter 6</a>). A self has free will, or the feeling we can do whatever we want to do, and self-location, which means we understand our current location. The self uses a first-person perspective. Finally, the self is embedded in a social network and is influenced by the quality of those relationships.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16f0 rs_skip" id="ZXKQ74SNCCRLK5ZKB464" clrenderdata="[&quot;XMRTG0TBZX2JD8USD240&quot;]" id-sequence="917"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata enlargedImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf23-t3.png" data-width="631" data-height="279"></div><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf23-t2.png" data-width="595" data-height="257" data-alt="Profile pictures of John Cacioppo and Laura Freberg on Facebook are shown.

To know yourself requires you to make the self an object to be examined. Just as you try to figure out what kind of people your classmates and instructor are, you have the capacity to turn this analysis inward to the self. Self-awareness, or knowledge of your own internal traits, feelings, roles, and memories, is the result of this self-study. In addition, self-awareness allows us to establish boundaries between the self and other people. When we talk about ourselves, look at ourselves in a mirror, watch a video of ourselves, or stand out from the crowd in some way, we become more self-aware than usual. This state of heightened self-awareness can be quite unpleasant. Many people experience a negative mood when they look in a mirror (<span class="citation" id="PWYNF7GBVF4KU6A3K418" id-sequence="954">Fejfar &amp; Hoyle, 2000</span>).</p> <p id="YQKDP31WVWYG9U4H7955" id-sequence="955">Related to this negative self-awareness is the concept of self-consciousness, our awareness of our own characteristics and the way the self is perceived by others. In many cases, we overestimate how much attention others pay to our behavior, a phenomenon known as the spotlight effect. When student participants wearing an embarrassing T-shirt featuring 1970s pop singer Barry Manilow entered a room full of other students, they expected at least half of their fellow students to notice (<span class="citation" id="SRXZP6HGWN0R3YDDD350" id-sequence="956">Gilovich, Medvec, &amp; Savitsky, 2000</span>). In fact, only 23% of the students paid attention to the T-shirts.

In other words, people with low self-esteem who fail one exam might assume that they are going to fail all their classes.

A sample of 1,600 young males in the 10th grade was followed for an additional 8 years (Bachman &amp; O’Malley, 1977). No evidence for a causal role for self-esteem in school performance was discovered. Instead, third factors, including socioeconomic status, IQ, and early school performance, appeared responsible for the correlation between self-esteem and school performance. Among studies that have reported a causal relationship between self-esteem and school performance, the direction of the relationship is not consistent with the commonsense hypothesis.

While a certain amount of self-regulation is related to training and supervision on the part of adults, individuals show different patterns of brain activation while facing temptation. Increased activity in the nucleus accumbens, which is implicated in processing reward and addiction, is associated with self-control failures, such as eating something we intended to pass by. Simultaneously, higher activity in the prefrontal cortex was associated with an individual’s ability to withstand temptation (<span class="citation" id="TPLT7WF93J0J1NK6D424" id-sequence="1096">Lopez, Hofmann, Wagner, Kelley, &amp; Heatherton, 2014</span>). In self-regulation, we make distinctions between what is good for the current self (eating a yummy treat) and what is good for the future self (having good health). We perceive the future self more like a different individual who stands in judgment of our current choices. Thus, activity in brain areas associated with self-centered (egocentric) thinking is associated with more impulsive and selfish decisions (<span class="citation" id="TJMKA4US5NKXRQFFA467" id-sequence="1097">Soutschek, Ruff, Strombach, Kalenscher, &amp; Tobler, 2016</span>).</p> <p id="YTZJKXVT4EG7GACR4507" id-sequence="1098">Self-regulation is made even more difficult because the harder we think about not doing something, the more likely we are to do it (<span class="citation" id="RGQJJS9HM3VUL8CB3428" id-sequence="1099">Wegner, 1994</span>). Try, for example, to avoid thinking about a white bear for the next 30 seconds. If you are like most people, your thoughts were suddenly dominated by images of white bears. We can explain this phenomenon as follows. When you try to control your behavior, you simultaneously activate a concern about failing. In an effort to avoid failure, you automatically pay more attention to the item or behavior to be avoided. “What exactly is this white bear thing I should avoid?” Because of this attention, we end up doing what we hoped to avoid doing.</p> <div class="media nbannotation prerendered nbid_5caf90f30ec112076ccf16fc rs_skip" id="LQSL28A9FVUGEFEBR943" clrenderdata="[&quot;LDBX90BLSFV2Y4JSM671&quot;]" id-sequence="1100"><div class="cluimedia_viewer_image rs_skip"><div class="metadata inlineImage" data-filename="61815_12_unf33-t2.png" data-width="298" data-height="369" data-alt="Various domains are spread across the cerebral cortex of the brain.

This delusion is highly relevant to our current discussion, because it represents confusion over the behavior produced by the self or by others.

In current psychological discussions of the self, influences on the interpersonal self fall into two categories: A person’s significant others and the social groups to which the person belongs. Significant others include family members, friends, coworkers, and others with whom the self interacts or has interacted. As we interact with significant others, we experience the relational self (<span class="citation" id="ERXT65S2V82L2E3X7781" id-sequence="1143">Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996</span>; <span class="citation" id="WPFS0HHKVLPMTGSNY511" id-sequence="1144"> Chen, Boucher, &amp; Tapias, 2006</span>).

The stories differed in the warrior chosen (the best individual for the job versus a member of the family) and in the benefits of the choice (benefits to the general versus benefits to his family).

Individuals with more self-control in regard to their anger and frustration are less likely to lash out and dominate others. However, as many people have learned the hard way, it’s easier to be impulsively and very publicly aggressive online than in person. Thus, cyberbullying might present unique challenges for emotional self-control compared to face-to-face bullying.</p> <p id="MTGLL0127G1V53CTG155" id-sequence="1194">Middle school bullies, regardless of whether they engage their victims in person or through digital technology, are able to perceive the emotional responses of others (<span class="citation" id="MGVTWM89PV8FFTB0X844" id-sequence="1195">Baroncelli &amp; Ciucci, 2014</span>). If anything, launching a successful attack demands that the bully have the ability to anticipate the victims’ responses. We can safely say that the bullies are not wreaking havoc by mistake—they understand the pain they are inflicting. What they seem to lack is the ability to inhibit their behaviors using emotional self-control. A difference between types of bullies appears, however, when you ask bullies to rate their own emotional regulation abilities. Face-toface or traditional bullies did not perceive themselves as having a problem with selfregulation, but cyberbullies gave themselves (perhaps more accurately) lower grades on emotional self-regulation (<span class="citation" id="QWLSU9NSAWADC1SV7724" id-sequence="1196">Baroncelli &amp; Ciucci, 2014</span>).
